                (1) What Is ShowDowN PrO And What Does It Do ?
             -----------------------------------------------------

   ShowDowN PrO is a script for mIRC v5.91 (newest recommended) and above to
 ease up the use of mIRC client and to make it as efficient and fun to use as
 possible. ShowDowN PrO is a high level, very advanced and modern mIRC script,
 a result of endless working and betatesting hours that have been spent in the
 making process of this script. And it shows. I would like to thank you for
 choosing ShowDowN PrO as your mIRC script, and I really hope you will enjoy
 using it as much as I enjoyed making it for you ! Welcome to the future...

             -----------------------------------------------------
                       (2) What Do You Need To Run It ?
             -----------------------------------------------------

    To be able to run, and to operate ShowDowN PrO with as little problems as
 possible, you will need to have the following hardware/software as a minimum:

 -=> Hardware:
   Pentium/AMD PC with minimum of 16 MB RAM, 8 MB HD space, (S)VGA display, modem
 or a network connection to the internet, soundcard (recommended) and a mouse.

 -=> Software:
   mIRC v5.91 or above EXE (newest mIRC version always recommended), Win95,
 Win98, Win2000 Or NT. Windows 3.1x with mIRC 16 bit works partially, clones and
 utils won't work because of the memory handling and the 32 bit utils.

                       (3) Installation Of ShowDowN PrO
             -----------------------------------------------------

      (!! DO NOT INSTALL TO FOLDER WITH SPACES LIKE C:\Program Files\ !!)

   Installation is different in ShowDowN v12 PrO than it was in versions below
 v10. It should be easier and than ever before. And as some people were quite
 unfamiliar with MS-DOS, the installation is now done in Windows. I have answered
 to some of the most common installation questions at the end of this section.
 
 -=> Installation in Windows95, 98, ME, NT or XP:

   Download the script file SDv12PrO.EXE from the URLs below. Run it and click
 "SetUp" button when the program asks. Choose a folder to install the script. You
 can choose your current mIRC folder, but all your settings will then be lost.
 Remember that the folder name MUST NOT include spaces in it, like for example
 C:\Program Files\ does. After the script files are extracted, you can close the
 installation program.

 After this just copy mIRC32.EXE (remember only v5.91 or above will work) into
 the folder you just chose in the installation program. Run mIRC32 from that
 folder and you are done !
 TIP: You can use Windows Explorer to easily copy mIRC32.EXE to the script folder
 if you like. Just drag and drop the file and then click to run it.

 If you wish, you can make a shortcut to the mIRC32 executable to your Windows's
 desktop using the icon file SD-Icon.ICO.
 TIP: Right click in the Windows's clean desktop to bring up a control popup.
 Select: New / Shortcut. Choose mIRC32.EXE that is in the ShowDowN PrO folder
 and then specify a name for the shortcut. Right click the icon you just created
 and choose: Properties. Click button "Change icon" and select SD-Icon.ICO.

 -!-!---------- FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ) - Please read: ------------!-!-

 - Where can I get the mIRC32 v5.91 and above executable ? 
 From the internet site at http://www.mirc.co.uk and from ShowDowN PrO site at:
 http://www.sci.fi/~showdown/ !

 - Will ShowDowN PrO work in Windows 3.1x with mIRC 16 bit executable ?
 It will work partially. For example the WaR Clones and the Shadow Clone can't
 be loaded, because the 16 bit mIRC doesn't allow multiple copies of it running.
 Some of the 32 bit programs in the script will not also work, but that's not
 really a problem, since most of the script features will work OK. I assume that
 you will get problems in the installation, since the extractor is real 32bit.

 - Where can I get the .DLL and .OCX files needed to run the WaR Utils ?
 Try searching ActiveX controls pack from the internet. It contains for example
 WINSCK.OCX and *.DLL files. If http://www.warforge.com doesn't work, I don't
 know any other site. Please don't e-mail me and ask for site URLs.

 - How come mIRC says "/run: command disabled" when I try to use the script ?
 This is because mIRC will disable the "/run" command by default to prevent fake
 scripts from doing harm to your computer. This is how to enable the command:
 Start the script up and go to: mIRC options / General / Lock / Disable commands.
 Uncheck the "/run" box. You can leave the "/dll" checked.
