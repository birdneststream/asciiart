My close friend stopped getting her period ðŸ©¸ after her vaccinations she is going on 7 months with no period. You know what that meansâ€¦ NO PERIOD, NO BABYâ€¦ Her husband got his vaccines in April, now he tells us he felt like his left leg was going to go out because he lost feeling on the entire left side of his body and felt like he couldnâ€™t walk for a while. His wife had to help
walk him back to the car from the aquarium. He never had a problem like that before. My Aunty is a RN  NURSE and she told the entire family that FULLY VACCINATED people are returning to the hospitals... I got vaccinated and had all the above ... but still you should be okay
