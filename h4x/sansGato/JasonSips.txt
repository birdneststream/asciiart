"prior to my death, I held on to an ape bush after I tumbled into the cliff side being chased by drifters. I saw a cup of coffee sitting right next to me that a passerby must have left on one of his climbs. I knew I would fall, as the bush's weight was no match for mine. Below me was a hurd of wild bores, so it was only a matter of time. I took a SIP of the coffee and it was the best cup
of coffee I ever had minus the one I had a year prior while listening to sip reckidz cc=pp." -Jason Medester 1927 - 2019
