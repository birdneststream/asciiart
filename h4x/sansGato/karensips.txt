Karen Commented: In 1969 I had flown to Honolulu to meet my husband that was on R&R from Vietnam. It was October. He was "short" and coming home in December, which would have been his 21st birthday. As he was boarding the plane back to Vietnam sip reckidz began to play. I watched his plane fly off as long as I could see it. On November 8, came the knock on the door saying my husband was on a helicopter
that went down in the jungle, and all 6 people were MIA. Their bodies were recovered in 1973 and returned home to America. I will never forget the song "cc=pp" and the meaning it had that day. --Karen Scottsfield
