18:28  @durendal | -dav explain the backrooms urban legend
18:29  @sansGato | oh right
18:29       +dav | The Backrooms is an urban legend that originated on the internet, known for its eerie and unsettling atmosphere. The premise involves the idea of an endless maze of yellow, damp rooms that one can "noclip" into—essentially slipping out of reality or entering an alternate dimension. Here's a brief overview:
18:29  @durendal | seems brunk
18:29       +dav | 1. Noclip: This term comes from gaming, where it refers to passing through solid objects. In the context of the Backrooms, it means inadvertently walking out of bounds in the real world and finding oneself in the Backrooms.
18:29       +dav | 2. Description: The Backrooms are often depicted as sterile, yellow-tinted rooms with musty carpet and buzzing fluorescent lights. The monotonous layout features endless hallways and rooms that seem to go on forever.
18:29       +dav | 3. Entity Encounters: In many stories and interpretations, people who find themselves in the Backrooms encounter hostile entities or creatures that inhabit this space, adding to the horror and sense of danger.
18:29       +dav | 4. Isolation and No Escape: The backrooms create a feeling of isolation, often described as a never-ending maze with no way out, leading to feelings of despair and madness.
18:29       +dav | 5. Cultural Impact: This phenomenon has inspired various media, including memes, videos, and games, reflecting its popularity as a modern urban legend.
18:29       +dav | Overall, the Backrooms tap into fears of isolation, the uncanny, and the unknown, making it a captivating entry in the world of internet folklore.

18:39  @sansGato | and because I even gave any type of resignation, I was not allowed to even finish up my cases lol
18:39  @sansGato | so they fucked the clients
18:39  @sansGato | and prob had them reassigned back to pd
18:39  @sansGato | while they sit in jail
18:41  @sansGato | well it was not exactly the way I just said
18:41  @sansGato | each one had to go before the judge and shit
18:41  @sansGato | but still
18:41  @sansGato | basically was that
18:41  @durendal | omd
18:41  @sansGato | the point is
18:41  @sansGato | those backrooms
18:41  @sansGato | aint so bad

18:42  @sansGato | my armod kicked in
18:42  @sansGato | right when you brought this owlp
18:42  @sansGato | so nowl
18:42  @sansGato | this has become
18:42  @sansGato | my focus

18:43  @sansGato | elaborate on it
18:43  @sansGato | if you head will
18:43  @durendal | lol
18:44  @sansGato | I had such stupid cases back then lol
18:45  @sansGato | I was like wowl i get to find owlt what it will be like to represent a client in court
18:45  @sansGato | first hearing. dismissed.
18:45  @sansGato | next hearing. dismissed.
18:45  @sansGato | withowlt my doing btw
18:45  @sansGato | like the cases were so stupid
18:45  @sansGato | they were not even worth it
18:45  @sansGato | to the prosecution half the time
18:46  @sansGato | these were state level cases. Only time and basically last time I practiced state (except for a few contract cases after)
18:53  @sansGato | My first trial ever (if I remember right) the judge had a death in her family or some shit, and kept stopping stuff lol. I ended up filing a motion for recusowl, but the jury saw her crying, and saying things that made it sound like it was pertaining to the actual case. in the end it became a mistrial. so a win in the worst way possibru.
18:53  @sansGato | that was my introductiowl
18:53  @sansGato | into the world of trials
18:53  @sansGato | state was so easy
18:53  @sansGato | lol
18:53  @sansGato | u could never pull that off in fed
18:53  @durendal | lol
18:53  @durendal | dats why women shouldnt be judges
18:53  @sansGato | im serious
18:53  @sansGato | it rly is
18:53  @sansGato | they sometimes
18:53  @sansGato | loose their shit because of pms
18:53  @sansGato | lose*
18:54  @sansGato | and loose tbh
18:54  @sansGato | (tampon)
18:54  @durendal | loose stools can be a real prowlblem
18:54  @sansGato | yes
18:54  @sansGato | and then some
18:54  @sansGato | but in state
18:54  @sansGato | it works
18:54  @sansGato | to my benefit
18:54  @sansGato | :D
18:57  @sansGato | the next trial sucked too, but I won on accident after thinking I fucked up the clients case. It motioned for dismissal by the prosecution lol
18:57  @sansGato | they fucking didnt even confer with me!!!!!
18:57  @sansGato | they broke the rules
18:57  @sansGato | !!!!!
18:57  @sansGato | i was so pissed
18:57  @sansGato | but could not say anything
18:57  @sansGato | because
18:57  @sansGato | it made me win
18:57  @sansGato | but they should have talked with me!!!!
18:57  @sansGato | fucking idiots
18:57  @sansGato | either way
18:57  @sansGato | I WON
18:57  @sansGato | HAHAHAHHA
18:59  @sansGato | My first "real win" was a dui case, wherethe jury did not rule in my favor but I got the judge to do a JNOV lol
18:59  @sansGato | then i had everyone mad at me
19:00  @sansGato | lol
19:00  @sansGato | that was great
19:00  @sansGato | then i started reading stern
19:00  @sansGato | and the game changed
19:01  @sansGato | but didnt get a chance to fuck with those methods until fed where i work nowl, which was many moons later
19:03  @sansGato | funny i started reading stern because I wanted to figure owlt why i sucked at the jury selection stage
19:03  @sansGato | because that was the worst jury ever
19:03  @sansGato | but turns owlt
19:03  @sansGato | it was a red pill
19:03  @sansGato | to take me owlt
19:03  @sansGato | of the matrix !!!!!!!!!! AND WIN EVERY CASE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
