Dave Asprey taking longevity supplements
Longevity & Anti-Aging
Dave Asprey has spent years refining his supplement stack to slow aging and support long-term health. His approach focuses on cellular function, reducing inflammation, and optimizing mitochondrial energy production. Instead of relying on a generic multivitamin, he selects individual compounds that provide specific benefits.
Nicotinamide Riboside (NR): Supports cellular NAD⁺ production, which plays a role in energy metabolism and longevity. Asprey initially endorsed NR as a way to boost NAD⁺ levels, a molecule essential for mitochondrial health. However, as more research emerged, he noted concerns about its efficacy and shifted his preference toward nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) as a more effective
option for longevity support.
Fisetin: A polyphenol found in strawberries, fisetin is known for its ability to clear senescent (damaged) cells that contribute to aging and inflammation. Asprey calls it a “longevity substance” because of its senolytic properties, which help maintain cellular function. He includes fisetin in his anti-aging routine to promote healthier aging by reducing cellular debris and
inflammation.
Collagen Protein: A key part of Asprey’s daily supplement stack, collagen provides amino acids that support skin elasticity, joint function, and gut health. He recommends at least 10 grams per day, often blending Bulletproof Collagen into his coffee or smoothies. Collagen is especially beneficial for maintaining healthy connective tissues, which tend to weaken with age.
Vitamin D3: Plays a critical role in immune function, bone health, and overall longevity. Asprey believes many people are deficient and takes 5,000 IU daily, significantly higher than the standard 400 IU found in most multivitamins. He highlights that adequate vitamin D levels are linked to reduced disease risk and better aging outcomes.
Vitamin K2: Works alongside vitamin D3 to regulate calcium absorption, ensuring it is directed to bones rather than arteries. Asprey includes both MK-4 and MK-7 forms of K2 in his Vitamin ADK supplement. He stresses that without K2, taking vitamin D alone can lead to calcium buildup in soft tissues, increasing the risk of calcification.
Vitamin A: Supports skin, vision, immune function, and cellular health. Asprey prefers the preformed version (retinyl palmitate) rather than beta-carotene, as some people cannot efficiently convert beta-carotene into active vitamin A. He typically takes 2,500 IU daily, often as part of his Vitamin ADK blend, since many people don’t consume enough organ meats, which are rich in vitamin
A.
Vitamin C: Plays a major role in collagen production, immune support, and mitochondrial function. Asprey takes at least 500 mg daily, emphasizing that vitamin C isn’t just an antioxidant but also helps regulate gene expression and metabolism. He also gets additional vitamin C from nutrient-dense foods like citrus fruits and leafy greens.
Vitamin E (Tocopherols/Tocotrienols): Asprey prefers getting vitamin E from whole foods like nuts, seeds, and avocados rather than high-dose supplements. He warns that excessive amounts of isolated vitamin E may increase mortality risk. Instead of mega-dosing, he ensures he gets enough through diet or in a well-balanced multivitamin.
Zinc & Copper: Essential for immune function, brain health, and antioxidant balance, these two minerals must be taken together to prevent deficiencies. Asprey takes 15–30 mg of zinc with a small amount of copper, as zinc can block copper absorption. He warns against taking too much of either, as excessive levels can become pro-oxidant rather than beneficial.
Iodine: Supports thyroid function, metabolism, and hormone production. Asprey is a strong advocate of iodine supplementation, noting that many people are deficient due to modern diets. He takes 1,000 µg (1 mg) daily, often using iodine/iodide drops like Lugol’s solution to maintain optimal thyroid health.
Omega-3 Fish/Krill Oil: Provides EPA and DHA, two fatty acids essential for brain health, heart function, and inflammation control. Asprey prefers krill oil over fish oil due to its superior bioavailability and phospholipid structure, which makes it easier for cells to absorb. He aims for 1,000 mg or more of combined EPA/DHA per day, often splitting doses between morning and evening.
Glutathione: Known as the body’s master antioxidant, glutathione helps protect cells from oxidative stress and supports liver detoxification. Asprey takes liposomal glutathione or its precursor, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), which helps maintain glutathione levels. He often increases his intake when traveling or under stress to boost his body’s ability to detoxify.
PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Supports mitochondrial health and cognitive function. Asprey includes 10 mg of PQQ in his Unfair Advantage supplement, a formula designed to enhance energy production at the cellular level. PQQ is known to stimulate new mitochondria growth, which may have longevity benefits.
CoQ10: Works alongside PQQ to enhance mitochondrial energy production. Asprey takes at least 100 mg daily, often as ubiquinol, the more bioavailable form. He believes that supporting mitochondrial function is key to slowing aging, a topic he discusses extensively in his book Head Strong.
Polyphenols: Found in coffee, green tea, dark chocolate, and berries, polyphenols have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Asprey created Polyphenomenal, a supplement that provides a concentrated dose of polyphenols to support cellular health and longevity. He believes these compounds activate pathways that help the body resist aging.
Curcumin: The active ingredient in turmeric, curcumin has powerful anti-inflammatory and cognitive-supporting properties. Asprey takes a liposomal or black pepper-enhanced curcumin supplement to improve absorption. He acknowledges that while research on lifespan extension is mixed, curcumin still has significant health benefits.
Apigenin: A flavonoid found in parsley and chamomile, apigenin may help enhance NAD⁺ levels by inhibiting CD38, an enzyme that depletes NAD. Asprey prefers getting apigenin from whole foods rather than supplements due to absorption challenges. He sees it as a potential longevity booster when used alongside NMN.
Senolytics & Other Longevity Aids: Asprey has experimented with additional senolytics like quercetin (a flavonoid with anti-aging properties) and hydroxytyrosol (found in olive oil). He also advocates for advanced longevity therapies like hyperbaric oxygen, stem cell treatments, and peptides, although these fall outside the category of dietary supplements.
Asprey avoids most standard multivitamins, believing they contain poorly formulated ingredients or incorrect dosages. Instead, his Dave Asprey supplement recommendations focus on high-quality, bioavailable nutrients that specifically support longevity and cellular function.
Multivitamins contain too low doses… or the wrong combinations… Therefore, we recommend taking some essential vitamins and minerals separately.

Closeup of cognitive enhancement supplements
Cognitive Enhancement & Brain Function
Dave Asprey has dedicated years to optimizing brain performance, experimenting with a mix of smart drugs, nootropics, and natural compounds. His approach focuses on improving focus, memory, and mental energy while minimizing cognitive fatigue. Many of his supplements are designed to support neurotransmitter balance, boost mitochondrial energy, and promote long-term brain health.
Smart Mode Nootropic: To simplify his brain supplement routine, Asprey formulated Bulletproof Smart Mode, a nootropic stack designed to support focus, memory, and mental energy. It contains Citicoline, Artichoke Leaf Extract, Rosemary, Theacrine, N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine, and vitamin B5. He credits this formula with replacing the dozens of individual supplements he once took, saying it helps
him stay mentally sharp every day.
Racetams (Aniracetam & Phenylpiracetam): Asprey has used racetam nootropics for years. Aniracetam (650 mg once or twice daily) enhances memory, verbal fluency, and mental speed, while Phenylpiracetam (100 mg per dose, up to 3–4 times daily) provides an intense focus boost and increased physical energy. Since racetams may deplete choline, he often pairs them with citicoline or egg yolks
to maintain balance.
Modafinil: A prescription wakefulness enhancer, modafinil was a core part of Asprey’s biohacking supplements during his Silicon Valley days. He took 100 mg in the morning to combat fatigue and improve productivity. While modafinil helped him power through long work sessions, he cautions against overuse, noting it is intended for treating narcolepsy and should be used responsibly.
Microdoses & Others: Asprey has experimented with microdoses of LSD and psilocybin for their potential effects on creativity and neuroplasticity. He has also tried low-dose nicotine (1 mg gum or lozenge) as a short-term focus booster. These aren’t daily habits but part of his past cognitive enhancement experiments.
Coffee & MCT (Bulletproof Coffee): Asprey’s Bulletproof Coffee is one of his most famous brain supplements. The mix of high-quality coffee, grass-fed butter, and MCT oil provides clean mental energy without crashes. The Brain Octane Oil in it supports ketone production, fueling the brain with a more stable energy source than glucose.
L-Tyrosine: This amino acid supports dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine production, all essential for focus and motivation. Asprey takes 500–1,000 mg of L-tyrosine or its N-acetyl form in the morning to stay sharp, especially when under stress or lacking sleep. It is also included in his Smart Mode formula.
NeuroMaster (Coffee Fruit Extract): Asprey developed NeuroMaster, a supplement based on coffee fruit extract, which can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by up to 140%. BDNF is essential for learning, memory, and neuron growth. He describes this supplement as “miracle grow for your brain” and takes 200 mg in the morning for a cognitive boost.
Eye Armor (Carotenoids & Antioxidants): Asprey formulated Eye Armor to reduce eye strain and protect against oxidative stress. It contains lutein, zeaxanthin, and astaxanthin, which filter blue light and support retinal health. Since eye fatigue can impact mental performance, he takes this supplement daily to preserve vision and enhance brain function.
Bacopa Monnieri & Herbal Nootropics: Asprey has praised Bacopa Monnieri, an Ayurvedic herb known for improving memory and reducing anxiety. He has taken ~300 mg of Bacopa extract daily in cycles to support recall and mental clarity. Other herbal nootropics in his stack include Rosemary (found in Smart Mode) and Coleus Forskohlii, which may enhance alertness by increasing cAMP levels in
the brain.
Asprey’s brain supplement stack blends scientifically backed compounds with biohacker-driven experimentation. The Dave Asprey supplement recommendations emphasize sustained cognitive performance, neurotransmitter support, and mitochondrial energy production, making them a key part of his daily routine.
