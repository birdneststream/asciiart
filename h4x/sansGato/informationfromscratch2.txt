16:00 < sansGato> 0 can be 0 and 1 at the same time, so like a super position can be a horizontal process
16:00 < sansGato> 0 being right
16:00 < sansGato> and 1 being left
16:00 < sansGato> assigned bits or normal bits, are vertical positions
16:01 < sansGato> the observation of said bits collapses the circuit
16:01 < sansGato> and gives the position through entanglement
16:01 < sansGato> this happens through gates
16:01 < sansGato> so
16:01 < sansGato> 0 is not infinite, it notates the number that other numbers derive from
16:02 < sansGato> this is why quantum computers could break rsa one day
16:03 < sansGato> i doubt dat
16:03 < sansGato> yeah
16:03 < sansGato> that is the one that will break rsa
16:04 < sansGato> probably
16:04 < sansGato> self destructs
16:04 < sansGato> it just breaks shit
16:04 < sansGato> but yeah
16:05 < sansGato> it takes normal bits in two's and entangles them and collapses into four bits
16:06 < sansGato> superpositions are just glorified 50/50 probabilities until you solve p v NP
16:09 < sansGato> he is busy right nowl
16:09 < sansGato> owl tell him u called
16:14 < sansGato> are u absolutely sure
16:15 < sansGato> if there are no absolutes, then you can not be absolutely sure there are no absolutes
16:17 < sansGato> not how dat works, you promulgate assumptions of absolutes. the point exists, the process of it's existence is where you have non deterministic value
16:18 < sansGato> Polynomial is deterministic, so the new age crap is nonsense.
16:22 < sansGato> yall high af
16:24 < sansGato> ct8 was right
16:24 < sansGato> yall higher than owl grape
16:25 < sansGato> stop

16:26 < sansGato> u all should be ashamed
16:26 < sansGato> dw1 ban them
16:26 < sansGato> please
16:26 < sansGato> BAN THEM ALL
16:26 < sansGato> sept me
16:26 < sansGato> and ct8
16:26 < sansGato> like the good owl days
16:27 < sansGato> it means great
16:27 < sansGato> in spanish
16:27 < sansGato> lol
