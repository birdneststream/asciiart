you thought you saw a demon.
you know that there's a d &,
now that you believe it.
you aint even seen it.
just know that i am breathin,
fucked around and feel it.
so sorry that you kneelin=
to say hello you leavin.
why would i not mean it?
you say that im a heathen.
you manifested seethin,
i'm organized i deal it.
a kindness i can peel it.
if being real i kill it,
you fake as fuck & tilted
with my word i seal it.
