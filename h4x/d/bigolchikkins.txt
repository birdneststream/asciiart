Z0d14c: Why you always be askin' me 'bout dem chickens, dawg? I was mindin' my own bizness, walkin' down da street, mindin' my own bizness, 
when I see dis big chicken. I'm thinkin' to myself, "Man, dat chicken is big." But I ain't never seen no chicken dat big 'fore, so I keep
on walkin'. But den I see anoder chicken, and den anoder chicken, and dey all be gettin' bigger and bigger. But I don't know why
dey be gettin' so big, so I keep on walkin'. But den I see dis one chicken, and he be even bigger dan all dem odder chickens. And he be 
comin' right at me, so I start runnin'. But he catches me, and he start touchin' me all ova. And I be screamin' and hollerin', but he 
don't stop. He just keep touchin' me and touchin' me, and I don't know why. And den I wake up.
