Yuri is the only sacred relationship in this world, as there are no 3D beings or disgusting 2D limpdick male characters. I love yuri for the fact that this situation only involves interaction between pure and holy hand-drawn females. There is no need for the existence of disgusting creatures with extra genitals poking out in this beautifully crafted world where girls sacredly hold hands, feeding each
other parfaits, whispering softly into each other ear and giggling. Imagine two innocent girls on bed touching each other affectionately, thinking about those lewd little things they could do to each other, tongues interlocking, savoring their partner's saliva while legs slowly embrace each other. This is the utopia we all hoped for, but none of us really deserved. Every night I cry myself to sleep
realizing that such wonderful world only exist because some men with the same ideology as me picking up brushes and making their dreams come true through anime, and none of it will ever be realized. I pray to Yuri god everyday, hoping that the moment I died, my conscious will eternally drift through every possible yuri scenarios, let my soul embed in the holy essence of yuri.
