Gentlemen,
I am proud to announce I have been elected president of the #101 chatting channel by some of the most esteemed members of the GameSurge Network. These chatters include SansGato, a Chicago lawyer, ChanServ, an internet robot, and Hitsugaya, a citizen of Singapore. The diversity and experience of the coalition backing my presidency is undeniable. The matter at hand is your official recognition of the title by 
granting me complete unrestricted g-line and server linking capabilities.
 
Although I may have a checkered past, including insanity and death threats against ChanServ, rest assured I am an ideal President for 101. I can start smoking weed again if that helps speed along my application.
 
Yours in Christ,
Chzz C. Chatman (Staff President)
