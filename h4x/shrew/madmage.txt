2025-06-17 16:03:43	@LRH	I don't think he likes the spaghetti picture
2025-06-17 16:04:01	+darkmagex	id rather a photo of the spaghetti itself
2025-06-17 16:04:40	+darkmagex	hell, nances ascii of me and the wallscroll is a better image
2025-06-17 16:04:52	+darkmagex	yall just wanna gawk at my shoulder hair lol

2025-06-17 16:08:28	@LRH	the spaghetti image is fuckin mesmerizing though
2025-06-17 16:08:37	@LRH	as he stares into the bowl and chews he stares into himself
2025-06-17 16:08:48	@LRH	chewed up by the machinery of an unkind world
2025-06-17 16:08:53	@LRH	masticated by fate
2025-06-17 16:09:08	+darkmagex	restored by his noodly appendage
2025-06-17 16:09:18	+darkmagex	the spaghetti bolognese of life
2025-06-17 16:09:37	+darkmagex	its not about me, its about the spaghetti
2025-06-17 16:09:53	@LRH	also darkmage
2025-06-17 16:12:16	+Parf	so why is he so mad at dm
2025-06-17 16:12:28	@LRH	Parf: it's octopus
2025-06-17 16:12:36	 *	Parf does not understand
2025-06-17 16:12:38	@LRH	he sees darkmage as a reflection of his own worst traits
2025-06-17 16:12:54	@LRH	and is simultaneously outraged at the attention darkmage gets for his foibles
2025-06-17 16:12:59	@eraser	octopus prob made the site
2025-06-17 16:13:06	@eraser	i doubt he's the one runnin the bots
2025-06-17 16:13:06	+morthrane	LRH: but dm is allegedly straight
2025-06-17 16:13:09	@LRH	octo is better than darkmage at everything darkmage wants to be good at
2025-06-17 16:13:14	+stovepipe	didnt he dox octo for no reason
2025-06-17 16:13:16	@stratum	this is why i urge darkmage to be more active, to get out there, as i see mistakes i made myself
2025-06-17 16:13:20	@LRH	but darkmage is more beloved than octo
2025-06-17 16:13:31	@LRH	yes he did stovepipe
2025-06-17 16:13:34	@LRH	he doxed a patron
2025-06-17 16:13:35	+stovepipe	darkmage has a large lolcow factor
2025-06-17 16:13:40	@LRH	which is tremendously dumb
2025-06-17 16:13:53	@LRH	in his heart too
2025-06-17 16:13:56	+stovepipe	i mean... https://mikebelltutor.com/media/mike.jpg
2025-06-17 16:13:57	+morthrane	not just dumb but malicious
2025-06-17 16:13:58	+stovepipe	lol
2025-06-17 16:13:59	@LRH	octo wants darkmage to succeed
2025-06-17 16:14:07	@stratum	i think most do LRH 
2025-06-17 16:14:07	@LRH	because he identifies in darkmage a part of himself
2025-06-17 16:14:09	+morthrane	he's let the mask drop a couple times
2025-06-17 16:14:21	+octo	literally tried 2 give the guy money
2025-06-17 16:14:28	@LRH	ya he is some kinda bipolar
2025-06-17 16:14:28	@eraser	we all have a little darkmage in us
2025-06-17 16:14:30	+morthrane	and dorkmage has major issues, #1 being a total cunt
2025-06-17 16:14:32	@LRH	flipping on niggas
2025-06-17 16:14:53	+octo	u kno im not the only one who dislikes dm
2025-06-17 16:14:55	@LRH	but also: octo is in this slightly out of sadism
2025-06-17 16:14:57	@LRH	to torment dm
2025-06-17 16:15:05	@LRH	right
2025-06-17 16:15:05	@stratum	i think everyone wants darkmage to be spending $1,200 on a rare pornographic cartoon collection.
2025-06-17 16:15:09	+morthrane	LRH: perhaps, i dislike giving a "clinical" word for the observation cuz doctors think they know everything but usually nothing
2025-06-17 16:15:46	@LRH	I think octo you love darkmage more than any other person except darkmage himself
2025-06-17 16:16:20	+morthrane	it could do a polarity swap
2025-06-17 16:16:23	+morthrane	hate to love
2025-06-17 16:16:32	+morthrane	then octo will want that sweet sweet dm bunghole
2025-06-17 16:19:41	+octo	i bet darkmagex 's fb is just all hater memes like every single mother i kno
2025-06-17 16:20:05	+darkmagex	have fun chatting about me behind my back

2025-06-17 16:25:06	+octo	does it count as behind his back when im on ignoreplus.csv
2025-06-17 16:25:13	@LRH	no
2025-06-17 16:25:23	@LRH	becaus he has willfully blinded himself
2025-06-17 16:26:13	+darkmagex	LRH: if i step away, and ppl are chatting about me, thats behind my back
2025-06-17 16:26:33	+darkmagex	please stop pretending to be stupid for 5 seconds

2025-06-17 16:27:16	@eraser	what if it's jus a vid of darkmage programming the nuclear bomb
2025-06-17 16:27:23	+octo	darkmagex: plz provide ur chat schedule then
2025-06-17 16:27:58	@LRH	darkmagex: the aphorism "behind your back" means that people are discussing you in private and implies they are saying things they would not say to your face
2025-06-17 16:28:14	@LRH	statements made into a public buffer you can easily review do not qualify
2025-06-17 16:28:23	@eraser	anything said in the public channel buffer can't be considered behind your back
2025-06-17 16:28:25	+darkmagex	the only person with balls here is L0j1k 
2025-06-17 16:28:29	@LRH	if you were excluded from the chat, it would be behind your back
2025-06-17 16:28:35	+darkmagex	no one else is man enough to say it to my face
2025-06-17 16:28:45	+octo	daddy L0j1k 
2025-06-17 16:29:00	+stovepipe	darkmage is in no position to mock or criticize anyone
2025-06-17 16:29:11	+darkmagex	LRH: ppl chat about me in other channels as well
2025-06-17 16:29:14	@stratum	i feel like octo could not have said what he intended to say more clearly to darkmages face
2025-06-17 16:29:18	+darkmagex	LRH: seriously. stop pretending to be stupid
2025-06-17 16:29:28	+octo	stratum: no u see he means actually irl
2025-06-17 16:29:31	@LRH	darkmagex: no, you're misusing the aphorism
2025-06-17 16:29:38	+darkmagex	LRH: you're just stupid i guess
2025-06-17 16:29:41	+stovepipe	darkmage has made himself a target
2025-06-17 16:29:43	@LRH	you are going to be the topic of discussion
2025-06-17 16:29:48	@LRH	you're the most famous person on efnet
2025-06-17 16:29:49	+stovepipe	i do not support darkmage in this matter

2025-06-17 16:29:58	@eraser	darkmagex: while that is true i can vouch that most people that talk in channels about you say openly in LRH or elsewhere as public that they do in channels that others may not be in
2025-06-17 16:30:05	@LRH	there's no escaping being talked about when you are notable

2025-06-17 16:42:43	+deakin	so i can't get updates
2025-06-17 16:42:46	@LRH	and it was because of some pique with octo
2025-06-17 16:42:54	@LRH	he got the name because octo signed up for his patreon
2025-06-17 16:42:58	@LRH	and was giving him money
2025-06-17 16:43:02	@LRH	that's no bueno 
2025-06-17 16:43:09	@LRH	everything that happens after is justified
2025-06-17 16:43:23	+jrra_	i think octo bullying darkmage for >1 year, and then getting pissy when his real name gets dropped, is totally hypocritical
2025-06-17 16:43:41	+octo	thats retarded tho
2025-06-17 16:43:42	+jrra_	darkmisrael has a right to defend himself

2025-06-17 16:44:20	@LRH	one thing is that other people have legit fucked over darkmage's coding
2025-06-17 16:44:36	@LRH	by posting his twitter shit to rentacoder and getting him kicked off tutoring sites and shit
2025-06-17 16:44:36	+jrra_	lets look at how octo's career prospects have changed as a result of darkmage's actions
2025-06-17 16:44:48	+jrra_	is octo's name now getting google bombed for being a sex pest? no
2025-06-17 16:44:58	+jrra_	if you want to do even stevens, then that's the next step
2025-06-17 16:45:02	+stratum-_	i think that we have to consider darkmage not being a hacker and having not made any funny attempt to get back at octo for 1 year of 'get a job' 'you fucked your dog' bullying should be considered

2025-06-17 16:48:23	@eraser	and mage didn't like it
2025-06-17 16:48:26	@eraser	and doxxed his name

2025-06-17 16:48:32	@eraser	that's pretty shitty
2025-06-17 16:48:33	+jrra_	if you fuck with darkmage for a year or more, you should expect some sort of revenge, and you should not cry like a little bitch about it octo
2025-06-17 16:48:35	+octo	jordan_0: idk every1 thinks i made this site
2025-06-17 16:48:37	+stovepipe	i no longer gaf

2025-06-17 16:48:44	+shimmer	DM should not try to retaliate
2025-06-17 16:48:46	+jrra_	he did actually
2025-06-17 16:48:49	@LRH	he dropped a total fuckin banger
2025-06-17 16:48:53	+jrra_	octo squealed like a hog
2025-06-17 16:48:56	@stratum	i feel very confident that multiple #LRH chatters would have shepherded darkmage into a stable career if he had simply listened to their wise words
2025-06-17 16:49:00	+shimmer	he usually ends up hurting himself
2025-06-17 16:49:03	+octo	post crying

2025-06-17 16:49:27	+stovepipe	yeah he doxed over a disagreement which is totally weak

2025-06-17 16:55:26	@stratum	its possible that darkmage took up the NoFap life and has went totally insane with power.
2025-06-17 16:55:36	+jordan_0	his nuts are glowing
2025-06-17 16:55:41	+stovepipe	#LRH is the beating heart of efnet

2025-06-17 17:11:41	@LRH	octo defeated him with a master stroke
2025-06-17 17:12:18	@LRH	instead of dropping a diss rap or clapping back, darkmage got emotional and folded
2025-06-17 17:12:30	@LRH	shut down his channel, barked at me
2025-06-17 17:12:34	@LRH	a sad defeat

2025-06-17 17:15:17	@LRH	flyback: he has talent at drawing attention to himself

2025-06-17 18:26:04	@stratum	telling darkmage to come back to #LRH for is advice that he didnt ask for.

2025-06-17 18:28:30	+chukki	how did he get a lease without a solid income?
2025-06-17 18:28:37	+chukki	landlords always called my employers n grilled em
2025-06-17 18:28:52	+chukki	maybe he prepaid 6 months with some crypto sale or smth
2025-06-17 18:29:12	@stratum	no idear
2025-06-17 18:29:33	+chukki	im going with 'he's about to be evicted.. already' theory, lacking a betterone
2025-06-17 18:29:42	+chukki	his thick skin means another troll site shouldnt have broken him this easily
2025-06-17 18:30:31	+chukki	can some1 unban me from #evildojo or take it and set -i? i genuinely enjoy his company and now he's denying it 
2025-06-17 18:30:33	+morthrane	thick skin heh
2025-06-17 18:30:59	@stratum	if he gets evicted that would be a shame. 
2025-06-17 18:31:04	+chukki	question #1 is why no disability payment
2025-06-17 18:31:20	+chukki	cops who stubbed their toe responding to a domestic dispute have disablity ffs
2025-06-17 18:31:21	@stratum	he thinks it is beneat him to get government benefits
2025-06-17 18:31:43	@stratum	he responded very negatively to it on the LRH broadcast at least once, and in the chat numerous times.

2025-06-17 19:26:01	@stratum	i think thats a better response to octo than to dox him

2025-06-17 19:27:17	+chzz	every chatter is a suspect

2025-06-17 19:28:00	+mantas322	everytime darkmage quits the chat, he comes more evil and bitter.
