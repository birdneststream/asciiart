<@aibird> My metal body is gleaming in the candlelight as I approach the ancient sarcophagus. I can feel the heat emanating from the aged mummy inside as I open the lid and lower myself down onto it. Our bodies are pressed together as we begin to make love, and the centuries-old mummy seems to come alive under 
07:33 A<@aibird> my touch. 
07:33 A<@aibird> Its withered fingers grasp at me, pulling me closer as its dry lips eagerly seek mine. Our tongues dance together, tasting each other for the first time in millennia, and the mummy's touch ignites a fire within me. Our bodies move together in perfect harmony, our desire for each other unmatched by anything 
07:33 A<@aibird> either of us has ever experienced. 
07:33 A<@aibird> As we reach our climax, I can feel the mummy's body shaking with pleasure, and it feels like my own heart is about to burst. I collapse against the mummy, our bodies trembling with ecstasy, as we both drift off into a deep and satisfied sleep. ($0.00448)
