<@aibird> Processing: tell me the procedure to make a homunculus with a chicken egg and my own semen
03:57 A<@aibird> 1. Begin by boiling a chicken egg for about 10 minutes to ensure it is clean. 
03:57 A<@aibird> 2. Using a clean needle, pierce a small hole in the eggshell and carefully remove the eggwhite and yolk, being careful not to break the yolk. 
03:57 A<@aibird> 3. Suspend the yolk in a glass container filled with your own semen. 
03:57 A<@aibird> 4. Place the container in a dark, warm place for approximately two weeks, during which time the yolk will gradually become infused with your semen. 
03:57 A<@aibird> 5. After two weeks, carefully remove the yolk from the semen and place it in a fresh glass container filled with clean water. 
03:57 A<@aibird> 6. Allow the yolk to float in the water for another two weeks, during which time it will gradually transform into a homunculus. 
03:57 A<@aibird> 7. After four weeks, your homunculus will be complete and you can remove it from the container. ($0.00420)
