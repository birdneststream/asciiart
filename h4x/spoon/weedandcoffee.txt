Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Weed and coffee, weed and coffee, weed and coffee
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Weed and coffee, weed and coffee, weed and coffee
Yeah, uh huh, smoking on that good
Sipping on that dark roast, feeling like I should
Rolling up that green, sipping on that bean
Got me feeling so fly, yeah you know what I mean
Got my grinder and my french press, that's a perfect match
Got the joint in my left hand, coffee in my right hand
Got that caffeine and that THC, got me feeling so free
Weed and coffee, my favorite combo, can't you see?
I'm in my zone, got my headphones on
Listening to Bob Marley, feeling like a king on his throne
Coffee for the morning, weed for the night
I'm living my life, feeling so right
Cup of joe and a blunt, that's my daily routine
Can't start the day without my coffee, can't end it without some green
Black and yellow, green and brown
Weed and coffee, the perfect blend, never let me down
So when you see me rolling, and sipping on my cup
Just know that I'm on that weed and coffee buzz
Living life to the fullest, no stress or worries
Weed and coffee, my love, my sanctuary
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Weed and coffee, weed and coffee, weed and coffee
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Weed and coffee, weed and coffee, weed and coffee.
