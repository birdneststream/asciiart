Fuck Alfred Perlstein
This is the second time in a short period that the project has lost one member due to the attitude of another. It wasn't that long ago that Asmodai left because of fucking Bill Fumerola (FUCK FUMEROLA!) Now it's Martin Blap, the person who ported OpenOffice to FreeBSD. Let's see what happened...
12:01 < mbr> angryskul: are you here ?
12:02 < mbr> angryskul: check the last patch I've sent you. And commit it please
12:10 < mbr> can someone commit this plz ?
12:10 < mbr>
http://docs.FreeBSD.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=131423+0+current/freebsd-current
12:12 < mbr> hey. just look at the patch ! it's easy h
12:13 <@green_> it's not easy
12:13 <@mux> if it's easy, you might as well commit it yourself
12:13 < mbr> mux: I cannot commit to src !!!
12:17 <@poseiden> mbr has a ports commit bit I thought
12:18 <@mbr> poseiden: ports only
12:18 <@poseiden> mbr: did you apply for src/ ?
12:18 <@mbr> poseiden: several times. I gave up
12:18 <@poseiden> did you have a mentor already chosen?
12:19 <@mbr> poseiden: that was the problem. DES agreed to be my mentor, but core rejected that
12:19 <@mbr> poseiden: that's why I got no /src commit bit
12:26 <@angryskul> mbr
12:26 <@angryskul> why don't you take some time to _Really think_ about the code you send me?
12:26 <@angryskul> that's why i have to wait at least half a week
12:26 <@angryskul> otherwise i get 15 patches for the same problem from you
12:27 <@angryskul> for the same file that breaks things in five different places
12:27 <@angryskul> also
12:27 <@mbr> angryskul: I'm really sorry. Have you looked at the last one ?
12:27 <@angryskul> martin
12:27 <@angryskul> stop wasting my time
12:28 <@angryskul> i'll look at it in a couple of days
12:28 <@angryskul> if i don't have a yet another patch from you for the same problem
12:28 <@angryskul> either that or try to trick some other committer into committing it for you
12:28 <@angryskul> you seem quite adept at that
12:28 <@mbr> angryskul: I got 0 response from you
12:29 <@angryskul> martin
12:29 <@angryskul> get bent ok?
12:29 <@angryskul> you got plenty of response
12:29 <@angryskul> i committed like 10 patches from you and your fucking buddy last week. That fucking bastard stole my last vodka
bottle!
12:29 <@angryskul> and it only broke like 5 different things
12:29 <@mbr> angryskul: hes _NOT_ my buddy
12:29 <@mbr> angryskul: and I did not told you to commit those patches
12:29 <@angryskul> perhaps you need to learn to chill out before annoying me and worsening your credibility with these bogus patches?
12:30 <@angryskul> i also committed your code which broke stuff too
12:30 <@mbr> angryskul: hey. that happens !
12:30 <@angryskul> mbr: yes, every time :)
12:31 <@mbr> angryskul: and the fix I sent you is a fix for tirpc99 code too. Because it fixes a bug there too
12:31 <@angryskul> that latest patch you gave me made my hair stand on end
12:32 <@angryskul> then i wait like 24 hours and i have a completely new patch from you
12:32 <@mbr> angryskul: ?
12:32 <@angryskul> ok
12:32 <@angryskul> GET OFF MY BACK ALREADY BEFORE I KILLFILE YOU
12:32 <@angryskul> GET IT?
12:32 <@angryskul> CAN I MAKE IT MORE CLEAR SOMEHOW?
12:32 <@mbr> angryskul: yes the last one was horrible. A fast fix. I tested everything now and found myelf that it didn't worked
12:32 <@gordont> hmp_: man module
12:32 <@angryskul> yeah no shit
12:32 <@mbr> angryskul: hey come down.
12:32 <@angryskul> imagine that, code from you that doesn't work
12:33 <@angryskul> i am calm
12:33 <@angryskul> actually, you make want to shoot heroin again
12:33 <@angryskul> y'know whaty
12:33 <@mbr> angryskul: look at the last version, and see why it is a correct one
12:33 <@angryskul> mbr, you win
12:33 <@angryskul> you're out of my inbox
12:33 <@mbr> tsss
12:34 <@mbr> angryskul: I expected more from you
12:34 <@mbr> angryskul: to help (and educate me if necessary)
12:35 <@angryskul> you can't teach a pig to sing
12:35 <@angryskul> i've been trying, but you never listen
12:35 <@angryskul> so piss off
12:35 <@mbr> angryskul: ohh nice.
12:35 <@mbr> angryskul: you tell me to leave the project ?
12:35 <@mbr> angryskul: You can have that !
12:35 <@angryskul> omg, listen: FUCK OFF MORON!
12:36 <@angryskul> i'm at least doing him the favor of explaining to him why
12:36 <@angryskul> and he's still on my ass about it
12:37 <@angryskul> mbr: i just gave you a response
12:37 <@angryskul> i told you to piss off
12:37 <@angryskul> and now i killfiled you
12:37 <@mbr> angryskul: correct. fine
12:37 <@mbr> angryskul: whatevery you like if it makes you happy
12:37 <@angryskul> because if i do respond to you then i get to hear about you complaining to core about me
12:37 <@mbr> angryskul: stop this discussion
12:38 <@mbr> angryskul: and don't make me responsible for broken patches I have nothing to do with (paul Richers from French)
12:38 <@mbr> angryskul: which is NOT my buddy
12:38 <@angryskul> i know, you have enough broken patches of your own
12:39 * mbr very very angry
12:39 <@mbr> bye all
12:39 * mbr will leave the project
point your irc client to efnet #bsdcode, wait...
I'd suggest you kick that shitsack of Perlstein out, but that would be useless, the number of assholes among the committers is so big it won't solve the problem. This is the fix: wipe FreeBSD out of your harddisks and install a real operating system (hint, it's called NetBSD) with a nice community. Who wants to stay on a sinking ship anyway? 5.0 has been a failure already, and it will when it's 
released.
