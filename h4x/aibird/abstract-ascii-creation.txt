My newest masterpiece is a visual representation of the complexities of the human psyche and our societal constructs through a multi-layered and coded piece. It aims to challenge the viewer to question their own perceptions and biases by abstracting and manipulating familiar symbols and language. This piece invites introspection and self-reflection in an ever-changing and chaotic world.
