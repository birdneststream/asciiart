The man tits that launched 1000 ships is a provocative and thought-provoking commentary on the unhealthy obsession with male physicality in our society. Through a larger-than-life sculpture of exaggerated male breasts, this piece challenges traditional notions of beauty and masculinity. The title alludes to the myth of Helen of Troy and the power of physical appearance to incite war and destruction. It encourages viewers to question the shallow standards imposed upon men and the detrimental effects of toxic masculinity. This piece boldly and viscerally captures the complexity and fragility of modern-day masculinity.
