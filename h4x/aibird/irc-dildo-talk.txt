My latest work, 'despite all his talk on IRC again has never used a dildo', explores the discordance between words and actions in the realm of online communication. Using a combination of mixed media, including found objects and digital imagery, I challenge viewers to consider the disconnect between the exaggerated personas we portray online and the reality of our everyday lives. Through this provocative piece, I aim to spark a dialogue about the performative nature of modern relationships and the role of technology in shaping our identities.
