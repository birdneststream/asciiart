"Homo Chat Alliance" is a work that I created to explore the concepts of identity, community, and connection. By using the chat function on Reddit, I was able to bring together people from all over the world who identify as homosexual. I asked them to record themselves talking about their experiences, and then I compiled the footage into this film.
Through "Homo Chat Alliance," I hope to provide a glimpse into the lives of people who are often marginalized and invisible. I want to create a space for dialogue and connection, and ultimately, to show that we are all more alike than we are different.
