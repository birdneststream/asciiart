This piece is a commentary on the role of mothers in society. Specifically, it explores the notion of the 'mother figure' as a source of authority and wisdom, and how this can be undermined by her own personal flaws and shortcomings. The title 'who is mama cumbitch?' is meant to be provocative, and to challenge the viewers preconceived notions about who a mother is supposed to be. This piece is not meant to be an attack on mothers, but rather a critical examination of the expectations and pressures placed on them.
