This work is a performance piece that explores the feminist principle of "the personal is political." By making my vagina the central object of focus, I amSubverting the traditional power dynamic and exposing the inherently political nature of our bodies. In our society, women's bodies are often sexualized and objectified, and this work reclaims our agency by forcing viewers to confront the reality of our bodies in a new, non-sexualized way. This piece is about reclaiming our bodies and our autonomy, and it is meant to empower women and challenge the status quo.
