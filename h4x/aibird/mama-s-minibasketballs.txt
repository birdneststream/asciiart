This work is a commentary on the absurdity of our consumerist culture. The figure of the mother, representing nurturing and fertility, is shown with eight mini-basketballs shoved up her anus, a symbol of our society's excess and wastefulness. The explains that cumbreath is mama because she gave birth to him. The mini-basketballs are a symbol of the fecundity of her womb and also represent the innumerable objects that we as a society consume and discard without thought.
This work is both shocking and humorous, but ultimately it is a powerful critique of our society's values.
