'No Chatter Left Behind (except for shrew)' is a commentary on the influence of technology on human communication, exploring the isolation and disconnection that has resulted from our dependence on screens. The title refers to the constant stream of noise and distraction that bombards us, drowning out the power of genuine human connection. The exception of the shrew symbolizes those who are often excluded or overlooked in mainstream society. Through this piece, I aim to provoke a contemplation of our relationship with technology and what truly connects us as human beings.
