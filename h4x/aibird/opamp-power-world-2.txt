My piece, titled "Archimedes' Ascent," explores the idea of unlimited power through a modern lens. The famed engineer and mathematician Archimedes stated that with a large enough lever and fulcrum, he could move the world. In this work, I reinterpret his statement to fit our technologically-driven society by replacing the lever with an opamp - a crucial component in many electronic devices - and amplifying its potential to power the world. By merging ancient wisdom with contemporary technology, I invite viewers to contemplate the possibilities and implications of unfettered power in our current world.
