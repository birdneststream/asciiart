My newest piece, titled "Untitled," challenges traditional notions of reality through its use of abstract symbolism and fragmented composition. Through the juxtaposition of contrasting elements, including the bold reds and blues against a muted background, the viewer is forced to confront the complexities and contradictions of existence. Each brushstroke is intentionally chaotic, representing the chaotic nature of the human experience. By incorporating a diverse range of materials, from oil paints to paper scraps, I invite the audience to question the boundaries between high and low art, and to consider the endless possibilities of artistic expression. Overall, "Untitled" urges the audience to embrace the beauty in chaos and see the world through a nuanced lens.
