My latest artistic endeavor, entitled 'weight loss', is a conceptual exploration of the societal pressure to conform to certain body standards and the detrimental effects it has on individuals. Through the use of various mediums such as painting, sculpture, and videography, I invite the viewer to critically examine the toxic beauty ideals perpetuated by our capitalist society. By presenting grotesque and distorted representations of the human figure, I aim to challenge the notion of a 'perfect' body and encourage a reevaluation of our perceptions of beauty. Ultimately, 'weight loss' serves as a powerful commentary on the damaging impact of societal expectations on our physical and mental well-being.
