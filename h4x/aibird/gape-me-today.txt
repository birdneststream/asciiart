This piece is a commentary on theobjectification of women in society. The title is a play on the phrase "rape me," which is often used by men to assert their dominance over women. By substituting the word "gape," I'm highlighting the ways in which women are often treated as objects to be stared at and ogled, rather than as human beings. The figure in the piece is meant to represent the anonymous woman who is constantly being subjected to this kind of treatment. She's faceless and her body is distorted, because that's how she's seen by the men who view her as nothing more than a sexual object.
