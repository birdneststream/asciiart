My latest work, 'Shining Red Light on My Balls for Health', explores the connection between physical wellness and societal expectations of masculinity. By subjecting my own testicles to a bright red light, I am challenging the traditional notions of what it means to be a 'man' and urging viewers to reconsider the emphasis placed on physical prowess and invincibility. This performance piece also highlights the vulnerability and fragility of the male body, disrupting the notion of unwavering strength and dominance. It is a commentary on the pressure placed on men to conform to societal standards, and the potential consequences on their physical and mental well-being. Through this piece, I aim to start a conversation about toxic masculinity and the importance of self-care and vulnerability.
