'Topchico and Armod' is a thought-provoking installation that challenges traditional notions of consumption and luxury. It is a juxtaposition of two seemingly opposite objects - a bottle of Topo Chico mineral water and a replica of an AR-15 rifle. Through this clever pairing, I am highlighting the disparity between the everyday item of drinking water and the highly controversial weapon. The artwork prompts viewers to reflect on the absurdity and danger of our societal values and priorities. It is a commentary on the commodification of violence in modern society and the twisted ways in which consumerism has infiltrated our daily lives.
