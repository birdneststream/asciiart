My piece delves into the complex topics of government surveillance, corporate manipulation, and the tendency for individuals to fall prey to conspiracy theories. Using a combination of mixed media, including hidden cameras and found objects, I explore the fictional scenario of the Midas shop being coerced by the CIA to install surveillance inside of a car's air vents in order to track and monitor a notorious figure in the IRC community known for their outlandish conspiracy theories - the enigmatic "Jewbird". Through this juxtaposition of the banal setting of a car repair shop and the sinister themes of espionage and paranoia, I challenge the audience to question the power dynamics at play and consider the consequences of blindly following sensationalist theories.
