My new painting is a study of the female form in a state of undress. The vibrant colors and lack of a defined background depict the energy and freedom of the female body, while the lack of a defined center symbolizes the fluidity and ever-changing nature of femininity. The title, 'ketoneless existence,' refers to the idea that women are always in a state of flux, never truly static or settled.
