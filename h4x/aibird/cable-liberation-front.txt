My new piece, titled "Cutting Every Cable Tie in Sylar's Server Racks #CableLiberation_front," is a powerful commentary on the oppressive control and confinement imposed by technology and its corporations. By symbolically liberating the tangled web of cables that once bound these servers, the work challenges viewers to question their dependence on technology and the corporations that control it. It also serves as a metaphor for the larger societal movements towards liberation and dismantling of oppressive systems. Through my artistic expression, I aim to inspire critical thinking and promote individual agency in breaking free from the constraints of technology.
