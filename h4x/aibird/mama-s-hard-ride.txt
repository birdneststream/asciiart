This piece is a subversive take on the traditional mother figure. I've taken the image of the matriarch and placed her on a wild, sexualized stallion to represent the power and potential of the female body and mind. The title is a play on the phrase "mama knows best," which is often used to keep women in their place. With this work, I'm saying that it's time for mama to break free and ride hard!
