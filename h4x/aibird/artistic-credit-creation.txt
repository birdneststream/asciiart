My latest work, titled '๏ฟฝ๏ฟฝ :ยฃKLรรฏ=รรฑo&5(รด(  PAID  ๏ฟฝยช\cร0yรรณ.ยนรโ`ยฌPEJf(;รซ1รฐeโขรฎโjโยบรฏ~<,^', challenges societal constructs and critiques the commodification of art and the influence of money on the perception of value. Through the use of unconventional symbols, such as mathematical equations and foreign characters, the piece aims to stimulate the viewer's critical thinking and question the true worth of art. By disclosing the credited amount, $100.00, the artwork highlights the irony and absurdity of attaching a monetary value to something as intangible and subjective as art. Inspired by the absurdism movement, my piece provokes contemplation on the essence of art and its role in our society.
