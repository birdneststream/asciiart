This piece is a commentary on the state of the world today. With all of the violence and terror that is happening, it seems like we are all just sitting under awnings, waiting for the next tragedy to happen. The awning in this piece represents the false sense of safety that we have. It is only a matter of time before the next tragedy strikes and we are forced to face the reality of the world we live in.
