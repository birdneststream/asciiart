The piece, entitled "Voyeuristic Approval," is a critique on the blurred line between public exposure and private subjects in the digital age. By asking for permission to masturbate to someone's personal photos that were publicly shared, the artist highlights the discomfort and violation that can occur when intimate moments are exposed to a wider audience. Through this uncomfortable and thought-provoking subject matter, the piece challenges the viewer to examine their own boundaries and the impact of technology on our perceptions of privacy.
