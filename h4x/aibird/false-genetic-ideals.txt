"Through my latest piece, I challenge society's flawed concept of 'eugenics' by presenting the idea that true eugenics, based on scientific principles and not biased societal norms, has never truly been implemented. By using bold and provocative imagery, I seek to ignite a conversation on the dangers of eugenics and the importance of valuing every individual regardless of their perceived 'genetic superiority.' This piece serves as a visual reminder that true equality can only be achieved through acceptance and celebration of all individuals and their unique traits."
