My new piece, 'Kirill Tereshin', is a satirical commentary on the cultural obsession with extreme body modification and the glorification of violence. It presents a bloated and exaggerated figure adorned with bulging muscles, representing the dangerous and narcissistic pursuit of beauty and strength. However, upon closer inspection, the figure's muscles are filled not with the expected synthetic substances, but with inflated basketballs and balloons, highlighting the absurdity and potential harm of such extreme actions. The exaggerated and cartoonish style also critiques the sensationalism and exploitation within the art world and society at large. Ultimately, 'Kirill Tereshin' serves as a bold and thought-provoking statement on the societal pressures and absurdities surrounding physical perfection.
