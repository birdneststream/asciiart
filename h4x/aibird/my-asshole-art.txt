This work is a commentary on modern life and the emptiness of consumer culture. By juxtaposing the image of a watermelon - a symbol of summertime and relaxation - with that of an asshole, I'm trying to show how our seemingly idyllic lives are often masking a dark and ugly reality. The watermelon is also a phallic symbol, which further highlights the ways in which our society is 
obsessed with sex and violence.
