Shrew doo doo is a commentary on the absurd and often contradictory expectations of bourgeois society, represented through the use of a seemingly insignificant creature - the shrew. By juxtaposing the refined intricacies of traditional art techniques with the raw, primal nature of shrew excrement, I seek to challenge our preconceived notions of beauty and worth. Through this unconventional medium, I invite the viewer to question their own elitist attitudes and the true value of art in a society driven by market trends and the validation of the upper class.
