This picture is a vibrant depiction of the emotional turmoil that a young man experiences after being rejected by the woman he loves. The orange and red colors signify the intensity of his feelings, while the black and white represents the emptiness he feels inside. The figure in the picture is shown in a state of despair, with his head in his hands and his body hunched over. This is meant to convey the idea that the man is completely broken by his experience, and that he may never be able to recover from it.
