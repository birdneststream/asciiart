My new masterpiece, 'a net spill GET BELOWL SAND,' explores the intricate relationship between human society and nature. Through a chaotic arrangement of tangled nets and spilled grains of sand, I convey the destructive impact that our modern lifestyle has on the environment. The urgency to 'get below' and reconnect with our Earth is apparent in the urgency of the composition. It serves as a bold call to action for the audience to reflect on their own impact and make changes to preserve our planet.
