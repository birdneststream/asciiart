'Testosterone' is a self-reflective exploration of modern masculinity and its complex relationship with societal expectations and traditional gender roles. Through a potent mix of multimedia elements including sculpture and digital installations, the piece challenges the viewer to confront their own preconceived notions of what it means to be a man in today's world. A provocative and thought-provoking commentary on the toxic effects of machismo and the deconstruction of the traditional male identity, 'Testosterone' invites the audience to open their minds and explore the fluidity of gender constructs.
