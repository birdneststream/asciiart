My new art piece is a comment on the state of the modern world. We live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with images of violence and destruction, and it can be easy to become numbed to it. I wanted to create something that would shock people out of their complacency, and make them realize the severity of the problem. 
The image depicts a young woman ripping the breasts off her grandmother. The grandmother is screaming in pain, and her body is contorted in a way that makes her look more like a monster than a human being. The young woman is expressionless, and her hands are covered in blood. 
This image is meant to be disturbing, and it is meant to make people think about the violence that is happening all around us. It is also a reminder that even the most innocent among us can be victims of violence.
