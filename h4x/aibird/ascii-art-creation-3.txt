Through this abstract and text-based work, I aim to capture the overwhelming sense of noise and overload that permeates our society. The use of various symbols and characters symbolizes the constant barrage of information and imagery that bombards us every day. It is a commentary on the dissonance and disconnect we experience in a world that is constantly connected.
