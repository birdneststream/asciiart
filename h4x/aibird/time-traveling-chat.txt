From a time far removed from our own, we speak a warning; 
Heed these words, prepare for the skies to be torn. 
A force greater than any seen will soon arrive, 
Chaos on a scale yet to be known will thrive.
Our pleas, our warnings, all go unseen, 
Fate bearing down on us, ever so keen. 
No shelter, no place, we cannot hide, 
Our fate lies in the hands of those who have lied.
Our cries, unheard, go into the air, 
We prepare for the terror, with no thought of repair. 
So protect all that you hold dear, 
Tread cautiously and with vigilant fear. 
Our message, now sent, unto you, 
Be warned, for all that's coming; this we must do. 
The evil looming, quickly draws near,
Protect what you love, and live in your fear.
"Messages from the distant future to an irc chatroom in the present day" is a work of art that explores the idea of communication across time and space. The piece features a series of messages that are sent from the future to a present-day chatroom, in an attempt to bridge the gap between the two time periods. The messages are intended to be open-ended 
and vague, in order to encourage discussion and interpretation from the viewers.
