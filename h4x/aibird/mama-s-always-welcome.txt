This work is a commentary on the state of the modern world. We live in a time where mothers are not always seen as the nurturers and caretakers that they once were. Instead, they are often times disregarded and seen as a burden. This piece is a homage to mothers everywhere who are still fighting the good fight. It also serves as a reminder that despite the challenges they face, they are always welcome in our lives.
