My latest work, titled '�� :£KLÔï=ßño&5(ô(  PAID  �ª\cÕ0yÏó.¹Õ„`¬PEJf(;ë1ðe™î—j‚ºï~<,^', is a commentary on capitalism and the concept of monetary value in art. The chaotic and seemingly nonsensical arrangement of symbols and characters represents the chaotic nature of our society's obsession with money and the pressure to quantify and assign a price to everything, even creativity and self-expression. By including a bold statement of 'CREDIT: $88.00', I am challenging the idea that art can only be valued based on its price tag. Ultimately, this piece serves as a reminder to question the true worth and value of art and to not let capitalism determine its significance.
