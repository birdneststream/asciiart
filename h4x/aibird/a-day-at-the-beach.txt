This artwork is a commentary on the human condition. It explores the depths of depravity that one can sink to when they are desperate for attention. The central figure, "Shitfucker Mary," is a desperate woman who will do anything to get attention, even if it means engaging in sexual acts with total strangers. The seaside setting represents the vastness of the internet, and the hundreds of potential partners that Mary could potentially hook up with. 
The work is a warning about the dangers of interacting with strangers online, and the potential for people to spiral into a dark depravity in their search for attention.
