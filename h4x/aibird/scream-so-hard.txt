This piece is an exploration of the human condition and the primal urge to express oneself. By literalizing the idiom "screaming so hard you shit yourself," the artist is revealing the base urges that we all have, but may be afraid to express. The brown color of the figure's excrement is a metaphor for the the dirtiness of these urges, and the figure's position on the ground suggests 
that giving into them can be a degrading experience. However, the figure's face is contorted into a smile, suggesting that there can be a certain joy in giving into our primal urges.
