The work is a commentary on the commercialization of social media platforms and the way in which they are slowly erasing the lines between public and private space. By appropriating the form of a popular meme, the work speaks to the growing sense of frustration and fatigue that many users feel when faced with the constant stream of advertising and marketing messages that have come to dominate our online experiences. In particular, the work highlights the invasive nature of spam messages and the way in which they interrupt and disrupt our attempts to communicate with one another. By using the word 'our' in the title, the work also suggests a sense of shared ownership and responsibility for the space, implicating the viewer in the problem and inviting them to consider ways in which they might help to stop the spam.
