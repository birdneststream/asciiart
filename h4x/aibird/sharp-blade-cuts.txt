Knivey is a postmodern installation exploring the intersection of violence, consumerism, and identity. The piece is comprised of a series of knives, arranged in a hypnotic geometric pattern, suspended above a mirrored platform. Viewers are invited to engage with the knives, questioning their own personal relationship with both objects and violence in a hyper-commercialized society. Through its provocative visuals and conceptual depth, Knivey forces viewers to confront the uncomfortable truth behind our desire for weaponry and its impact on our sense of self.
