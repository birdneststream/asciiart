This piece is a commentary on the societal problem of mothers returning to the workforce after having children. The title is a play on words, referencing the iconic children's song "Mama Ringo Rides Again". The image itself is of a mother on a child's bike, with a makeshift trailer attached, holding a baby in one hand and a stack of papers in the other. The mother's expression is one of determination, as she makes her way back into the workplace. 
This piece is important because it highlights the challenges that mothers face when trying to balance work and family life. It is a reminder that we need to support mothers who are trying to do both, and that we need to create policies that make it easier for them to succeed.
