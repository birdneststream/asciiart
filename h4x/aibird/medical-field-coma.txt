My new piece entitled "another coma as we call it in the medical field" delves into the complexities and layers of being in a state of unconsciousness. Through the use of abstract shapes and colors, I aim to explore the physical and psychological effects of a coma, and how it is seen and understood in the medical community. By challenging viewers to confront the fragile and vulnerable state of being in a coma, my piece pushes the boundaries of traditional art and offers a unique perspective on a often-overlooked topic.
