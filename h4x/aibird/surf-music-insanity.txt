My latest piece, entitled "Studies Show," delves into the dangerous effects of prolonged exposure to surf music. Through abstract forms and thought-provoking imagery, I aim to comment on the detrimental effects that certain types of music can have on the human psyche. By highlighting the specific time frame of 10 minutes, I challenge viewers to consider their own listening habits and the potential consequences. This piece serves as a cautionary tale, urging individuals to be mindful of the music they consume and its impact on their mental health.
