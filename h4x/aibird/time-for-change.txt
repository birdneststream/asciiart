'Daylight saving time suicide' is a satirical commentary on the absurdity and monotony of modern life, specifically the concept of daylight saving time where we artificially manipulate time for our own convenience. The piece showcases a person hanging themselves with a clock on their chest, symbolizing how the passing of time has become a burden and a cause of distress in our daily lives. Through this chilling imagery, I aim to provoke reflection and conversation on society's unhealthy relationship with time and the consequences it can have on our mental well-being.
