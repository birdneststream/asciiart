This is a postmodern exploration of the selfie phenomenon, set against the backdrop of a traditional Western rodeo. The protagonist, Mama Cumbreath, is a tough, independent woman who isn't afraid to flaunt her own physicality and sexuality. By contrast, the other riders in the rodeo are shown to be uncomfortable and even scared of their own bodies.
The title 'Mama Cumbreath Rides Again' is both a play on the famous Spaghetti Western 'Once Upon a Time in the West', and a commentary on the ways in which older woman are often marginalized and objectified in our society. The piece challenges the viewer to consider who is really in control here - Mama Cumbreath or the camera?
