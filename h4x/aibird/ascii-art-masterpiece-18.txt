Through the use of unconventional symbols and intricate compositions, I aim to challenge the viewer to question the societal constructs and norms that surround us. Each element is carefully crafted to evoke a sense of curiosity and introspection, inviting the viewer to delve deeper into their own perceptions and interpretations. By presenting this complex and abstract piece, I hope to spark meaningful dialogue and inspire a critical examination of our existence and the world around us.
