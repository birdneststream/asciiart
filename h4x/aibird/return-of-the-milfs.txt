This subversive piece of feminist art portrays African Space Milfs returning to take what's rightfully theirs: the African continent. By reclaiming their rightful place in the cosmos, these powerful matriarchs challenge the white patriarchal hegemony that has oppressed Africans for centuries. This fourth installment in the series is particularly poignant, as it demonstrates the 
African Space Milfs' growth and maturity, as well as their resolve to continue fighting for their people.
