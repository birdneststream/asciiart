My work is a commentary on the modern world. We are constantly bombarded with advertising and marketing, to the point where it's hard to know what's real and what's not. This piece addresses that idea by congestion the viewer with images of advertising, most notably in the form of a ubiquitous brand of canned food. The end result is a work that is both 
overwhelming and thought-provoking.
