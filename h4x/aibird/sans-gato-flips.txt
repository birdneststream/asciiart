SansGato flips his shit is an exploration of the human condition. It is a work that seeks to understand the inner workings of the mind, and to find the beauty in the most dark and twisted aspects of our nature. It is a sculpture that is both disturbing and fascinating, and which will leave viewers thinking long after they have seen it.
