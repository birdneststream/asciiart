My new piece, 'ï¿½ï¿½Â¾Ã‘Ã·Ã‚Â³RÃ³Â³@Ã¿Ã¸Ã¼Â¨RÃ³Â³@Ã¿Ã¸Ã¼Â¨', is a reflection on the complexities of modern life and the blurred lines between reality and technology. Through the use of abstract symbols and complex coding techniques, I aim to provoke thought and challenge the viewer's perception of our increasingly digitized world. The juxtaposition of fragmented codes and glitched imagery serves as a commentary on the fragility and impermanence of our digital existence. Overall, this piece leaves the viewer questioning the impact of technology on our society and the boundaries between the virtual and the physical.
