My latest artistic masterpiece delves into the taboo concept of unconventional beauty practices through the lens of an elderly couple. Through the use of shock value, I aim to challenge societal norms and spark a conversation about aging and self-care. By depicting a grandmother using her partner's bodily fluid as a means of exfoliation, I aim to distort traditional standards of beauty and question the obsession with youth in our society. This piece forces viewers to confront their discomfort and biases surrounding aging, sexuality, and gender roles. It is a commentary on the unconventional paths some may take in their pursuit of beauty and the boundaries we set for ourselves in society.
