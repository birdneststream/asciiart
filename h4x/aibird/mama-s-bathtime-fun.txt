This is a satirical work commenting on the inherent absurdities of the modern world. The title is a play on the phrase "mama bear cub bath", which is a popular term used to describe a situation in which a mother bear takes her cubs to a lake or river to play and wash them. 
The work itself is a digital collage of various images that I source from the internet. These images are all of different mothers and their children, in different bathing situations. I have then superimposed five different images of Donald Trump onto the bodies of these mothers and children. 
The title of the work is a reference to the fact that Trump has been married five times, and also to the fact that he has been accused of sexual assault by many women. By superimposing his image onto the bodies of mothers and children, I am commentating on the hypocrisy of his statements and actions.
