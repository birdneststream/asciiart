This art piece is meant to be a powerful and edgy statement on the current state of our society. It addresses the issue of rape culture head on, and forces the viewer to confront the ugliness of it. The figure in the center is meant to be a representation of all women who have been victims of sexual violence. The words 'bitch rip off ur clothes im an incel and ur about to be RAPED!!' 
are meant to evoke the harrowing reality of rape culture, and the fear that many women live in. This piece is meant to provoke thought and discussion about rape culture, and to ultimately help create a world where women can feel safe and respected.
