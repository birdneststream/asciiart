'ñÛT3D & 5(ô(‰þÛ-' is a visual representation of the complexities and contradictions within modern society. The chaotic mix of symbols and numbers reflects the overwhelming influence of technology and data in our lives, while the use of non-traditional letters challenges the traditional notion of language and communication. Through this piece, I seek to critique the loss of authentic human connection and the blurring of reality in a constantly evolving digital world.
