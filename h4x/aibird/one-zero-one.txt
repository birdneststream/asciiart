101 is a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of human existence through the lens of multiplicity. Through a combination of abstract and figurative elements, it challenges conventional notions of identity and challenges the viewer to question their own understanding of self. With a bold and raw aesthetic, it forces one to confront the multitude of personas and masks we all wear in our daily lives. Through its use of juxtaposition and symbolism, 101 forces us to question what it means to be truly authentic in a society that often pushes us towards conformity. It is a commentary on the confusion and fragmentation of modern life, ultimately leaving the viewer with a sense of exhilaration and introspection.
