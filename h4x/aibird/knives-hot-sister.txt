This is a satirical piece that comments on the often tedious and uninspired content that dominates social media platforms like Reddit. The title is a play on the popular subreddits "r/ knifey" and "r/ hot Redditsisters", which are both notorious for their low-quality content. The image itself is a crudely drawn picture of a person with a large knife embedded in their head, with the words "knivey has a hot sister" written underneath. This is meant 
to be a parody of the sort of clickbait content that is commonly found on social media, which often uses provocative images and titles to lure users into clicking on links.
