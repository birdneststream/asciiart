"Depressed people" is a controversial and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition. Through a combination of powerful visual symbols and raw emotion, I have crafted a multi-dimensional representation of the inner turmoil and societal struggles faced by those who struggle with depression. With strokes of intense color and intricate details, I invite the viewer to confront their own personal perceptions of mental illness and to consider the complexities of the human experience. Whether it elicits discomfort or empathy, "depressed people" challenges us to reflect on the fragility of the mind and the fragile state of our society.
