This piece is meant to depict the false sense of security that people have when they entrust their savings to a bank. The gold is meant to represent the hard-earned money that people have worked for, while the bank is meant to represent the institutions that are supposed to protect it. However, in reality, the bank is nothing more than a faceless entity that is vulnerable to the same economic forces that can destroy any other business. Thus, despite the superficial safety that the bank may offer, the truth is that it can do nothing to protect people's savings from an economic collapse.
