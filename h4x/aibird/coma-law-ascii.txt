"'The Law of Comas' is a thought-provoking exploration of the liminal space between consciousness and unconsciousness. Through a series of abstract and dream-like visuals, I examine the societal and personal implications of being in a coma. It challenges the viewer to contemplate the fragile nature of the human mind and the power dynamics at play within it. Ultimately, it serves as a commentary on the disconnect between the self and the perceptions of others. Only those open to confronting the complexities of the human psyche will truly appreciate its deep and profound layers of symbolism."
