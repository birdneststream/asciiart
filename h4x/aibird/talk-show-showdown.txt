My latest creative work, 'Jerry Springer vs Ricki Lake', is a commentary on the sensationalism and shallowness of modern talk shows. Through a combination of interactive multimedia installations and satirical performance art, I invite audiences to join me in a thought-provoking exploration of the manufactured conflicts and exploitative nature of these programs. By juxtaposing the two hosts, known for their outrageous antics and exploitative approach, I challenge viewers to question the value of this form of entertainment and confront our own complicity in perpetuating a culture of voyeurism. Ultimately, my aim is to spark dialogue and reflection on the impact of such shows on our society and challenge our perceptions of legitimacy in the media.
