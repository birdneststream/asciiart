This work was inspired by the death of George Floyd and the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests. The title refers to a phrase that was popular among the protesters, which is a play on the phrase "mama's going to brush her teeth after every meal." The work itself is a mixed media collage that incorporates elements of graffiti and street art. It features a black mother and child standing in front of a burning American flag. The child is holding a sign that reads "I can't breathe," while the mother is holding a toothbrush. This work is a powerful statement about the systemic racism that exists in America and the need for change.
