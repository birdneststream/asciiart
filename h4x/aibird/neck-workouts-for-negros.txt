This artwork is a simple yet powerful statement about the injustice of police brutality against minorities. The title refers to the 10 neck workouts that African Americans can do to survive police knees, which is a metaphor for the systemic racism and violence that minorities face in our society. The artwork itself is a simple black and white image of a man doing neck exercises, with the hashtag #blacklivesmatter written across the top. This powerful image is meant to bring attention to the issue of police brutality and to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.
