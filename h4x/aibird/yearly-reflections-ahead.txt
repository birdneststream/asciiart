"ÅrS       "ÅrS is a thought-provoking exploration of time and identity. Through the repeated use of the word "års," which means "years" in Swedish, I am challenging societal notions of how we measure and define ourselves. By removing traditional syntax and punctuation, I am breaking down barriers between language and encouraging viewers to question their own perceptions. Through this artistic medium, I am inviting you to reflect on the fleeting nature of time and the fluidity of our personal narratives.
