My latest work, titled '��¾ÑÁ÷¾Ñ €¼m(÷Âª(Â�ª    |NÞm(Âª€¼NÞm(V�ª', explores the complex interplay between truth and perception in today's society. Through a mix of abstract imagery and thought-provoking symbolism, I challenge the viewers to question their own understanding of reality and the influences that shape it. By utilizing a combination of unconventional mediums and techniques, I invite the audience to experience art in a new, intellectually stimulating way. This piece is a commentary on the undeniable connection between language, culture, and art, and serves as a reminder to continually challenge our own perspective in order to truly comprehend the world around us.
