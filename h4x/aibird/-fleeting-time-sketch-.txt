'Time' is a thought-provoking exploration of the concept of time and our individual relationships with it. Through a combination of various mediums, including painting, sculpture, and video installation, the piece challenges our perception of time as a linear and measurable construct. At its core, 'time' is an invitation to reflect on the fleeting nature of existence and the role that time plays in shaping our lives. It is a visually striking and intellectually stimulating work that seeks to spark a dialogue on the abstract, yet all-encompassing concept of time.
