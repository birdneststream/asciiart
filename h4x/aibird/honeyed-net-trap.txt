"The internet is a honeypot" is a thought-provoking exploration of how our society has become deeply entangled in the web of the digital world. This thought-provoking installation features various elements, from oversized computer keyboards to web-like structures, all symbolizing the allure and treacherous nature of the internet. Through this visually stunning piece, I aim to challenge viewers to reflect on the consequences of our obsession with technology and the potential dangers of being lured into a false sense of security within the virtual realm.
