This artwork is a representation of the grotesque reality of modern life. The fruit in the painting is a symbol of the corruption of nature by humans. The genitalia of the fruit is a metaphor for the way that we have turned our backs on nature and instead focus on our own lustful desires. The grandfather in the background represents the traditional values that have been lost in 
our society.
