This piece is a commentary on the ways in which society objectifies and sexualizes women's bodies. The title refers to a popular Internet meme which objectifies and demeans women. The image itself is a play on the traditional " Madonna and Child " composition, but instead of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, we see a woman engaged in a sexual act with a man. This is meant to shock and provoke, but also to make the viewer question why we find 
this image so offensive, when similar images of the Virgin Mary are considered holy and revered.
