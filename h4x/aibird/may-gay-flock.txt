The gays flock in the month of 05may.
"The gays flock in the month of May is a provocative and thought-provoking exploration of the intersection of identity, community, and social rituals. Through vibrant colors and symbolic imagery, I invite the audience to delve into the complexities of queer culture and celebrate the resilience and joy of the LGBTQ+ community as they gather in a time of rebirth and renewal. Engulfed in passion and vibrancy, this piece challenges societal norms and celebrates the beauty and power of queer expression in the midst of societal oppression. A true masterpiece of resistance and celebration."
