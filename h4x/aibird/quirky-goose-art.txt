Goosr is a visual representation of the contradiction and complexity within human nature. It is a commentary on our tendency to conform to societal norms while at the same time yearning for individuality and originality. The piece utilizes minimalist techniques and a striking color palette to highlight the duality of human existence. Through the juxtaposition of simplicity and intricacy, Goosr invites the viewer to question their own perceived notion of self and the societal constructs that shape it.
