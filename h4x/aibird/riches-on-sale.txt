"Dollar for a Dime" is a visual representation of the cyclical nature of our capitalist society. Through the juxtaposition of a high-value dollar bill and a lowly dime, it challenges the viewer to question the true worth of these currencies, both in monetary and societal terms. Through this piece, I aim to critique the widespread obsession with wealth and the inequality it perpetuates. At the same time, it serves as a commentary on the fragility of our economic systems and the potential for a single dime to hold the same value as a dollar in the future. Overall, "Dollar for a Dime" challenges societal norms and prompts introspection on our values and priorities.
