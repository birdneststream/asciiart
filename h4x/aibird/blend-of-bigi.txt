My latest artistic masterpiece is a abstract representation of the merging of two realities - the traditional, human world (Bi) and the modern, digital world (Cgi). By combining elements from both realms in a chaotic yet balanced composition, I hope to challenge our understanding of art and technology and the intersection between the two. The addition of Ri (reality) serves as a reminder that no matter how advanced our digital world becomes, we are still rooted in and affected by our physical reality. Ultimately, this piece is an exploration of the fluidity and coexistence of multiple realities, inviting the viewer to question their own perception of the world.
