This piece is intended to confront the viewer with the reality of racism and bigotry that still exists in our society. By repeating the slur 'nigger' over and over, I want to highlight how these words are still used as weapons to hurt and marginalize people of color. The word 'faggot' is also used as a derogatory term for gay men, and so by using it in this context, I want to show 
that homophobia is also still a major problem that needs to be addressed.
