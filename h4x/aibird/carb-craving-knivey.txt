"Knivey eats carbs" is a provocative exploration of our relationship with food and desire. Through a minimalist and highly stylized approach, the piece delves into the complex intersection of indulgence, consumption, and self-control. With sharp wit and biting social commentary, it challenges societal norms and invites viewers to question their own perceptions of pleasure and restriction. Through the lens of a single utensil, it ultimately begs the question: are we truly in control of what we consume, or are we simply being consumed by our desires?
