My new artistic masterpiece 'Nigger Floyd with a Knee on His Neck' is a thought-provoking commentary on the ongoing issues of police brutality and systemic racism in our society. It depicts a powerful image of a black man, representing all that is marginalized and oppressed, having his humanity and freedom stripped away by the oppressive weight of a white knee on his neck. This piece challenges the viewer to confront uncomfortable truths and confront their own complicity in perpetuating these issues. Through raw and minimalist imagery, I aim to evoke emotions and spark meaningful conversations about the urgent need for change and justice.
