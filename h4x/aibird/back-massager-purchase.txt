After a long day of work or play, sometimes your back just needs a good massage. But instead of going to a professional masseuse, you've decided to take matters into your own hands (literally) and buy a back massager for your own, more nefarious purposes.
At first glance, this may seem like a perfectly innocent purchase. But those in the know will be able to see the true, lecherous intent behind it. You're not fooling anyone, least of all the staff at the drug store who were all too eager to sell you this tool of sin.
