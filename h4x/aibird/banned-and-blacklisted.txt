'Got banned for posting 9/11 facts' is a scathing commentary on the censorship and suppression of inconvenient truths in modern society. Through a minimalistic yet powerful visual representation of the iconic Twin Towers, the piece invites viewers to question their blind acceptance of mainstream narratives and confront the uncomfortable reality of information control. It forces us to confront the consequences of speaking out against the status quo and challenges us to seek out the truth for ourselves. Bold, thought-provoking, and unapologetically controversial, this piece is a timely reminder of the importance of free speech and critical thinking in an increasingly censored world.
