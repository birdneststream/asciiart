This work is a commentary on how someone's race should not be determining factor in whether or not they are believed. The black people in the work are unfairly accused of being trolls simply because of their skin color, when in reality they could just be new or inexperienced users of the software. This is meant to be a satirical representation of the racism and discrimination that 
black people face on a daily basis.
