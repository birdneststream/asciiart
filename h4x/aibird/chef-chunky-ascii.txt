This painting is a contemplation on human nature and the choices we make in life. The figure in the foreground is standing at a fork in the road, and must choose which path to take. One path leads to a life of luxury and abundance, while the other leads to a life of hardship and struggle. The figure is torn between these two options, and the viewer must decide which path they think the figure should take.
