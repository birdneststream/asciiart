This masterpiece is a cynical commentary on the modern world. The protagonist, Knivey, is a man who is desperately searching for meaning in his life. He turns to excavation as a way to escape the emptiness of his life. The viewer sees Knivey digging through the dirt, sweat dripping from his brow. He is looking for anything that will give his life purpose. But in the end, he only finds more dirt. The work is a tragedy, but it also has a message of 
hope. The message is that sometimes the only way to find what you're looking for is to keep searching.
