This artwork is a representation of the phenomenon of information overload that we experience in the digital age. The term 'IP Sniff' refers to the process of gathering information about someone or something by monitoring their data communications. In this painting, I have used a variety of different colors and shapes to create a chaotic and overwhelming image that reflects the deluge of information that we are constantly bombarded with. By overwhelmed, I mean that the majority of people cannot process all of the information they're taking in, and as a result, are only seeing a small fraction of what's really going on around them.
