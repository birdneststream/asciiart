My latest work, entitled "I think I just shit my pants but no one will know because I," explores the contradictory complexities of the human experience. Through the use of mixed media and dark humor, I challenge societal norms and the pressure to appear perfect. The piece presents a raw and vulnerable look at the fear of being exposed and the struggle to maintain a facade of composure. It serves as a commentary on the inauthenticity of our curated selves in the digital age.
