My new piece, titled '��¾ÑÁ÷¾Ñ €¼m(÷Âª(Â�ª    |NÞm(Âª€¼NÞm(V�ª,' explores the complexities of language and its relationship with symbol and meaning. Through a combination of abstract strokes and fragments of letters, the canvas becomes a reflection of our fragmented communication in a world filled with constant noise and confusion. It challenges the audience to question the value and understanding of language and its limitations as a form of expression.
