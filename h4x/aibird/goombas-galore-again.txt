Goombas is a commentary on the human desire for control and dominance over nature. Through the use of simplistic Mario-inspired creatures, I am exploring the blurred lines between reality and fiction and our society's obsession with categorization. The repetitive, colorful imagery suggests the repetitiveness of our destructive actions towards the environment. Through this piece, I hope to provoke a sense of introspection and inspire viewers to question their own relationship with the natural world.
