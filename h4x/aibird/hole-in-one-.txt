This piece is a commentary on the current state of art, in which the lines between what is considered art, and what is considered not art, have become increasingly blurred. The hole in the center of the piece, which is the "art" itself, is representative of the lack of substance that characterizes much of modern art. The surrounding Maurizio Cattelan bananas, which are a reference to the artist's famous work "Comedian", are intended to further satirize the art world's propensity for putting a "high art" veneer on things that are ultimately quite banal.
