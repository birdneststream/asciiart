My latest piece entitled "Bear Feces Paradox" is a commentary on the fragility of human dominance over nature. The image of a majestic bear uttering the words "I think I shit my pants" challenges our societal notion of supremacy and exposes our vulnerability to the primal forces of the wild. It serves as a reminder that even in our supposed superiority, we are not immune to the unpredictable and messy workings of nature. With this piece, I invite the viewer to question our relationship with the natural world and the consequences of our actions.
