'Shrew is all jacked up on Mountain Dew' is a provocative piece that delves into the hyper-stimulated, consumer-driven society we live in. The shrew, a symbol of small and insignificant creatures, has been warped and distorted by the excessive consumption of a highly caffeinated and sugar-filled beverage. The bright and chaotic colors represent the overwhelming effect of consumer culture on our psyche. It is a commentary on the dangers of overindulgence and the consequent distortion of our physical and mental selves.
