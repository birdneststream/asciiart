My new work explores the dark realities of life through the lens of an all-too-familiar domestic scene. By juxtaposing the banal with the tragic, I hope to challenge viewers to consider the fragility of life and the things we take for granted. In 'grandmothers surprise: suicide vest', an elderly woman's knitting is interrupted by the shocking discovery of a suicide vest hidden in her home. This work seeks to explore the terror and devastation that can lie beneath the surface of everyday life.
