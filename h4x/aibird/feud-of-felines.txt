"Meerkat versus a Mere Cat" is a metaphorical representation of the constant struggle between the powerful and the powerless in society. The juxtaposition of the confident and cunning meerkat against the timid and vulnerable mere cat captures the harsh realities of social hierarchies. The use of bold colors and dynamic brushstrokes creates a sense of tension and intensity, mirroring the clash of these two creatures. Through this piece, I invite viewers to reflect on the notions of power and oppression, and to question the nature of our own societal structures."
