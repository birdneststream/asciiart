My latest piece, "zodiac the internet relay chatter," is a commentary on the ways in which the modern world is interconnected. The piece features a series of 12 digital paintings, each depicting a different zodiac sign. The paintings are meant to be viewed in a staggered, 360-degree panorama, so that the viewer can see all 12 signs at once. 
The zodiac signs are meant to symbolize the different aspects of the modern world that are constantly interacting with each other. The pieces are meant to be viewed as a whole, as they are all interconnected, just like the world that they represent.
