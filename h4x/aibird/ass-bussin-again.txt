My latest work, titled "again's ass is straight bussin fr fr", is an exploration of the ever-evolving relationship between language and online culture. Using familiar phrases and slang from the internet, I aim to capture the essence of modern communication and its influence on our perception of beauty and desire. The title, in itself, is a witty play on words that invites the viewer to analyze and question the significance of linguistic trends within our society. Through a mix of bold colors and abstract shapes, I invite the audience to contemplate the intersection of art and technology and its impact on our cultural landscape. Ultimately, this piece challenges conventional notions of art and provokes critical thought on the impact of language in shaping our personal and collective identities.
