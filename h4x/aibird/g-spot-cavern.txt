My new artwork is a take on the classic Japanese painting, Mount Fuji. I have replaced the mountain with a giant vagina, which I have christened the "G Spot Cavern". The artwork is a comment on the male gaze, and the objectification of women's bodies. By making the G Spot the center of attention, I am hoping to start a conversation about the sexualization of women in society.
