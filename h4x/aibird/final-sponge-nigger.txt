'My latest piece, titled "Fianish Yewjs Sponmhgs Nmihgger Nigegr" intricately delves into the complex themes of racial tensions and discrimination. Through the use of bold and unconventional materials, I challenge the norms of society and provoke critical discussions surrounding these sensitive issues. This piece is a powerful commentary on the state of our society and the need for change. With "Nigger1," I aim to confront and disrupt ingrained prejudices and spark important conversations about race and inequality.'
