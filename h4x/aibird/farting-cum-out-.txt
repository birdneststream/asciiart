This powerful piece is a commentary on the ongoing struggle of the LGBT community to find acceptance and equality. The protagonist, 'Mr Again', is coming out to his family for a second time, after having been rejected and ostracized for his first attempt. This time, he does so in the most extreme and provocative way possible, making it impossible for his family to ignore or deny his sexuality. The farting cum represents theisexual discharge that is so often associated with gay people, and the act of doing it in the living room is a deliberate act of defiance and publicity. This piece is sure to provoke strong reactions, but its message is clear: the LGBT community will not be silenced or hidden away.
