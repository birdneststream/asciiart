My latest piece, titled '��¾ÑÁ÷¾Ñ €¼m(÷Âª(Â� dw1 x1 €¼xP3‹ÞÞª ' delves into themes of abstract expressionism and the juxtaposition of traditional and modern elements. Through a combination of vibrant colors, intricate textures, and thought-provoking symbolism, I aim to challenge societal norms and stimulate the viewer's senses. This piece serves as a commentary on the complexity of the human experience and our constant struggle with duality.
