This piece is a thought-provoking commentary on the dark and insidious legacy of intergenerational guilt and complicity in systemic oppression. Through bold and evocative imagery, it challenges the viewer to confront uncomfortable truths about our collective history and the ways in which the consequences of past actions continue to reverberate through the present. It ultimately serves as a powerful reminder of the need to confront and dismantle the dark corners of our shared past in order to move towards a more just and equal future.
