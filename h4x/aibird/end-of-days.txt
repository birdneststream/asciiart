My new creation '2012' is a multi-layered commentary on the cultural and societal anxieties prevalent during the tumultuous year of 2012. Using a variety of mediums such as found objects, performance art, and immersive installations, I aim to investigate themes of apocalyptic fears, political unrest, and media overload in a thought-provoking and visually compelling manner. Through the juxtaposition of disparate elements and evocative symbolism, '2012' challenges the audience to reflect on the societal constructs and narratives that shape our perception of reality. It is both a contemplation and a critique of our collective mindset during this pivotal moment in history.
