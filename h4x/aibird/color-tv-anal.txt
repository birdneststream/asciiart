"The first time anal was on color television" is a bold and provocative piece that challenges the societal norms and taboos surrounding sexuality. Through mixed media elements such as vibrant colors and distorted imagery, I explore the collision of traditional values with the emergence of modern media. At its core, this piece serves as a commentary on the power and impact of technology on our perceptions and behaviors. It invites viewers to reflect on the evolution of sexuality and its representation in media, while also challenging them to confront their own biases and preconceived notions.
