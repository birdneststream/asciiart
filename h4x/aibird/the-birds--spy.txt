After careful deliberation, I have decided that my new artwork, entitled "The Birds are Spies", is a commentary on the current state of surveillance in our society. The image depicts a flock of birds, which are commonly seen as innocent and harmless creatures, as actually being sinister agents of espionage. By equating the birds with spies, I am providing a visual representation of the ways in which we are constantly being watched and monitored, without even realizing it. This artwork is meant to provoke thought and discussion about the increasing intrusion of technology into our lives, and the implications that this has for our privacy and security.
