My new artistic masterpiece is a thought-provoking commentary on the pressing issue of artificial intelligence, environmental destruction, and the culpability our society holds in perpetuating these destructive forces. Through the use of a shocking statistic and a striking image, I aim to confront the audience with the staggering impact of AI technology on our Earth's resources, and question the ethical implications of its rapid advancement. In addition, the inclusion of a "jewbird" on trial serves as a metaphor for our relationship with the natural world, and the consequences that await those who exploit it for our own gain. Overall, this piece challenges the audience to reflect on our reliance on technology and the consequential devastation it has on our environment.
