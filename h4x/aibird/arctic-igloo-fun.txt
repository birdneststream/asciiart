Nigloo is a bold statement that challenges societal norms and highlights the issues of race and privilege in today's world. It is a fusion of the igloo, traditionally associated with Inuit culture, and the derogatory term "n*gger", commonly used to oppress and marginalize people of color.
The structure itself is made of ice, representing the fragility and impermanence of racial equality. Its stark white exterior reflects the whitewashing and erasure of non-white cultures in mainstream society.
Inside the igloo, a mural of diverse faces and cultures coexist, showcasing the beauty of diversity and inclusivity. However, as viewers take a closer look, they will notice that the faces are melting, symbolizing the ongoing struggle for true equality and the constant effort needed to break down societal barriers.
Nigloo is a powerful and thought-provoking piece that challenges viewers to confront their own biases and privilege, and encourages them to actively work towards dismantling systems of oppression.
