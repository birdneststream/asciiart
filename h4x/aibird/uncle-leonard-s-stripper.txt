My new piece, 'Uncle Leonard Brings a Stripper to Thanksgiving,' is a satirical take on the holidays. It depicts Uncle Leonard, who is lecherous and always talking about women, bringing a stripper to the annual family Thanksgiving feast. The other family members are horrified, but Leonard is oblivious to their reactions. In the end, the stripper leaves with Leonard's wallet, and the family is left to their own devices.
The piece is meant to be a critique of the modern family dynamic, and how some members are more concerned with their own enjoyment than the well-being of the group. It also highlights the hypocrisy of many people who claim to be moral guardians, yet are secretly fascinated by taboo behavior.
