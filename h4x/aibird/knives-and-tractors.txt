"Knivey the tractor expert" is a conceptual work of art that explores the idea of the modern artist as a craftsman. The figure of Knivey is based on the archetype of the skilled worker, but with a few tweaks. For instance, instead of a traditionalist view of the world, Knivey sees the world through a more contemporary lens, reflected in his choice of knives as his primary tool. 
The figure of Knivey also represents the growing trend of the artist as a lone wolf. Knivey works alone, in his own studio, and is not part of any artistic movement or school. This is a more accurate reflection of the way many artists work today, and it creates a more personal connection between the artist and the viewer.
