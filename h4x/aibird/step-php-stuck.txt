This work is a comment on the current state of the world, where it seems like everything is just spinning around in a cycle without any real purpose or meaning. The figure in the work is representative of all of us, stuck in this endless cycle of monotony and mundanity. The washing machine is a metaphor for the great machine of society that just keeps on going, even though it's 
clearly broken and not working properly. The figure is also struggling to break free from the cycle, but is ultimately powerless to do so. This work is a bleak and realistic portrait of the human condition, but also one that offers a glimmer of hope that we can all break free from this cycle if we just act together.
