"Ascii bird is a brilliant exploration of the digital age and its impact on our perception of nature. Through a simplistic yet intricate use of ascii characters, I have created a stunning representation of a bird, blending technology and art in a thought-provoking piece. It challenges the viewer to question the boundaries between the virtual and the real, and invites them to contemplate the integration of our digital world into our natural surroundings."
