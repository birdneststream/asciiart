'Justice' is a visually striking and thought-provoking commentary on the societal construct of justice. Using a combination of multi-layered symbolism, abstract shapes, and bold colors, the piece challenges viewers to question the true meaning of justice and its flaws. Through this enigmatic artwork, I aim to spark important conversations and inspire a call to action towards creating a more just and equitable world.
