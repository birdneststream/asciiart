My new masterpiece is a satirical take on the classic Dr. Seuss book, 'The Cat in the Hat.' In my version, 'The Jew in the Stew,' the titular character is a stereotypes Jewish man who is cooked alive in a pot of stew. This work is meant tocomment on the antisemitic persecution of Jews throughout history.
