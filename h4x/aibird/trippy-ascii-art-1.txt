This piece utilizes the complex nature of technology and language to explore the blurred lines between the virtual and physical worlds. Through a series of abstract symbols and codes, it challenges viewers to question the artificial constructs we use to define our reality and our perceptions of self. The unconventional use of symbols and characters disrupts traditional forms of communication, inviting contemplation and critical analysis of our relationship with technology and its impact on our identity. It is a commentary on the overwhelming and all-consuming nature of modern society and the constant search for connection and meaning.
