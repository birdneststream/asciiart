This striking piece is a comment on the way society tends to ignore the hundreds of thousands of refugees that enter Europe every year. The black holes represent the man-made problems that force these people to leave their homes, and the blood-red impasto oozing from them highlights the human cost of these crises. The title refers both to the dangerous 
journey these refugees must undertake, and to the way they are often treated as invisible by the rest of us.
