Umbilical Hernia is a conceptual exploration of the complex relationship between the physical body and societal expectations. Through a mixed media installation, I challenge the traditional notions of beauty and perfection by featuring a protruding sculpture resembling an umbilical hernia, symbolizing the vulnerability and imperfection inherent in our bodies. The piece illuminates the societal pressure to conform to conventional standards of physical appearance while championing the beauty of embracing and accepting our unique selves. It serves as a powerful commentary on the human experience and prompts viewers to question the constructs of beauty and self-image in modern society.
