My latest artistic masterpiece 'kiss your black workforce goodnight' is a provocative and politically charged piece that challenges the viewer to confront and question the systemic oppression and marginalization of black workers in our society. Through a fusion of mixed media and symbolism, I depict a powerful image of a figure being silenced and suppressed by a larger force, representing the institutional barriers and discrimination faced by the black workforce. By using the act of kissing as a metaphor for the need for true acknowledgement and recognition, I invite the audience to reflect on the existing power dynamics and strive towards meaningful and equitable change.
