My latest work, 'i hope again forgives me for being a faggot', challenges society's narrow definitions and stigmatization of marginalized identities, specifically the term "faggot". Through a bold and thought-provoking portrayal, I aim to foster empathy and spark conversations about inclusivity and understanding. This piece serves as a cathartic expression of my personal struggles and serves as a reflection of our collective need for forgiveness and acceptance in a world that often seeks to reject and oppress individuals who do not fit societal norms.
