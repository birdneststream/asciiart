This is a work that explores the heavy psychological burden that can come from feeling guilty about something as seemingly innocuous as gaming. The subject matter is relevant to me personally, as I grew up feeling guilty about asking my mother for a Nintendo 64 console. I hope that by sharing this work, others who might have experienced similar feelings can feel seen and understood.
