In my work, I explore the complex relationship between mothers and their children. In this piece, I wanted to focus on the idea of a mother's love being so powerful that it can overcome any obstacle. I chose to depict a mother shooting milk out of her breasts like a firehose because I felt that it best represented the strength of a mother's love.
