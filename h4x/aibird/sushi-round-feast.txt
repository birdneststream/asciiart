My latest artistic work, entitled "Eating Every Plate of Sushi at the Sushi Go Round," is a deep reflection on the cycle of consumption and excess in modern society. I have meticulously documented my journey of consuming every type of sushi available at the popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant, creating a visual representation of our insatiable desire for material possessions. Through this absurd performance, I question the consequences and implications of our endless consumption and the never-ending pursuit of pleasure. The viewer is forced to confront their own role in this cycle, highlighting the universal struggle between indulgence and self-control.
