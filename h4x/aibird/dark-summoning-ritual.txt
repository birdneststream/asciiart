"Pentagram to summon Satan is a thought-provoking exploration of the dark and mysterious realm of occultism, using the iconic symbol of the pentagram as a gateway to the underworld. Through intricately detailed and boldly juxtaposed imagery, this piece challenges the viewer to confront their own perceptions of good and evil, and the power dynamics that exist within religion and spirituality. It is a raw and unapologetic commentary on the human obsession with the concept of the devil, enticing the viewer to question their own place in the larger cosmic order."
