This work is a reaction to the current coffee industry. It is a provocative statement about how we as a society have become too reliant on coffee and how we have lost touch with what is truly important. The slime represents the mass-produced, watered-down coffee that we drink on a daily basis. It is a sad comment on our society and how we have become addicted to caffeine.
