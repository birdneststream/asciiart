My latest artistic creation "east_atlanta_santa gives children illegal mexican phone sims for christmas" is a social commentary on the state of consumerism and inequality in our society. Through the spectacle of a fictional figure, East Atlanta Santa, I highlight the dangerous and unethical actions of corporations and individuals who prioritize profit over the wellbeing of marginalized communities. By presenting this act of giving as a form of subversion and resistance, I challenge the audience to question the impact of their own consumer habits.
