This piece addresses the limited and controlled communication of modern society through the use of a traditional chat organ, symbolizing the suppression of true self-expression. The slow and short movements of the panel represent the sluggish pace of true dialogue and the restriction of genuine connection. Through this work, I aim to shed light on the artificial nature of our interactions and challenge the audience to examine their own participation in this constructed system.
