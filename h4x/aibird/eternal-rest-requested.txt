'Can I Be Dead Yet' is a satirical commentary on our societal obsession with instant gratification and escapism. Through the use of bold and provocative imagery, I challenge the audience to question their own mortality and the consequences of constantly seeking out quick fixes to avoid facing uncomfortable truths. With this piece, I hope to start a conversation about the damaging effects of our current cultural climate and encourage reflection on the true meaning of life. Thank you.
