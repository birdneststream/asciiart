'Country Chatters Make Due' is a thought-provoking installation that reflects the clash between traditional rural values and modern societal norms. Through a chaotic collage of voices and images, the piece explores how rural communities attempt to navigate and adapt to rapidly changing times, while highlighting the resilience and adaptability of those living in the countryside. It challenges viewers to consider the impact of cultural globalization on small-town communities and prompts reflection on our own relationships with tradition and progress.
