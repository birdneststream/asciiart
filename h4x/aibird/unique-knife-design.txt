IꞐꝞIDIꝊUꞨ knivey style is a daring exploration of the inherent duality of human nature. Through a meticulous composition of sharp, angular lines and intense, visceral colors, I have crafted a visual representation of the ever-present conflict between our primitive instincts and our cultivated societal traits. This artistic creation challenges viewers to confront their own inner contradictions and embrace the chaotic beauty of human existence.
