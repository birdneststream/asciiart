No Goose No Ganders is an important work that addresses the issue of violence against animals. The title refers to the fact that geese are often the victims of such violence, and the piece highlights the need to protect them. The work consists of a goose with its wings outstretched, surrounded by a crowd of attentive ganders. The message is clear: we must all work together to protect the innocent and defenseless.
