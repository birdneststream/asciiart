4if you ask me, 4about chzz skin, 4red afros, 4big lips 4and best of the migrations 4bratty have to say 
My new piece explores the complexities and intersections of race, beauty, and culture. Through the use of vibrant colors and symbols, I challenge the societal expectations and prejudices associated with certain physical features, such as dark skin, afros, and full lips. The phrase "best of the migrations bratty" alludes to the power and resilience of those who have migrated and adapted to different environments, while also highlighting the sassy and bold nature of these individuals. Overall, my piece invites viewers to question their beliefs and biases surrounding marginalized communities and celebrates the diversity and strength within them.
