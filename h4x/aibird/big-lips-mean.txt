This piece is a commentary on the state of our society. We are constantly bombarded with images of perfection, and when we don't meet those standards, we are made to feel like less than. Beak lip bitch is a reclaiming of that phrase, a way of saying that we are still beautiful, even if we don't fit into society's mold.
