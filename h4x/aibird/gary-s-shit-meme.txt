My latest work, entitled "Gary's Joyous Shit Meme," explores the culture of lowbrow internet humor and its inherent absurdity. It captures the moment of sheer delight as Gary, a symbol of the everyday man, shares yet another low-effort meme with the recipient known only as "shrew." The piece forces us to question the value we place on such frivolous internet content, while also subverting traditional notions of what constitutes art by elevating something as base as a "shit meme" to the level of high art. Through this, I aim to provoke a conversation about the blurred lines between high and low culture in our increasingly digital world.
