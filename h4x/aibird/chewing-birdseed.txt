The work is a deconstruction of the nuclear family unit and the dynamics therein. The birdseed, in this instance, represents the time, effort and love that a mother puts into caring for her children. The act of chewing the birdseed is a metaphor for the selfless care that a mother provides for her child. By extension, the work is also a commentary on the expectations placed on women in our society.
