"Two in the pink, shoe in the stink" is a work that seeks to explore the interplay between the body and the object. In particular, it focuses on the relationship between the shoe and the foot. The work itself is a sculpture of a shoe with a foot inside it. The foot is in a state of decomposition, and the shoe is surrounded by a pink aura. The work is meant to explore the idea of the body as a site of both pleasure and pain, and the object as a source of both pleasure and pain. It is also meant to explore the idea of the body as a site of both decomposition and regeneration.
