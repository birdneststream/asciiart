"Sentient sperm bucket" is a Snobby Reddit Intellectual Artist masterpiece that snobbishly and intellectually mocks the plebeian masses by making them believe that a sperm bucket could be sentient. This is, of course, an absurd idea, and the very notion that someone could take such a thing seriously reveals the ignorance and stupidity of the general public. The work itself is a simple black and white drawing of a sperm bucket with a human-like face. The face is adorned with a smug expression, as if it is laughing at the stupidity of those who would believe that it could be anything other than a inanimate object. This work is a searing indictment of the dumbing down of society, and a warning that we must be ever vigilant against the forces of ignorance and stupidity.
