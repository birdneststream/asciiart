This artwork is a commentary on the rampant economic inequality in our society. The horses represent the rich and powerful, while the balls represent the poor and vulnerable. By crushing the balls, the horses are showing their complete disregard for the well-being of others. This piece is a call to action, urging us to stand up to the rich and fight for a more just and equitable society.
