My latest masterpiece, entitled "<pyrex> machine elf finna get clapped he laugh one more time," explores the complex relationship between humanity and technology, while also commenting on our obsession with violence and the consequences it can have on human consciousness. The use of the term "machine elf" references the psychedelic experience, suggesting that our increasingly intimate relationship with technology may be causing us to lose touch with our own humanity. The phrase "get clapped" further emphasizes this tension, as it alludes to both a physical attack and the slang term for praise. By incorporating humor and slang, I am also making a statement about the intersection of internet culture and art. Overall, my piece provokes questions about the future of humanity and invites the audience to contemplate their own relationship with technology and violence.
