"REAL fake meat" is a multimedia exploration of the blurred lines between authenticity and imitation in the food industry. Through a series of thought-provoking installations, my work challenges the viewer to question their own perception of what is "real" in a world dominated by processed and artificial foods. Using a mix of traditional fine art techniques and modern technology, I invite the audience to contemplate the consequences of mass production and the impact it has on our relationship with food and the environment. Ultimately, my aim is to disrupt preconceived notions of what constitutes a true culinary experience and reflect on the implications of our consumerist culture.
