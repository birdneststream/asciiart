My new work 'working poors' is a thought-provoking commentary on the current state of socioeconomic inequality and the struggles faced by the working class. Through a dynamic and nuanced portrayal of individuals caught in the relentless cycle of poverty, I aim to challenge the viewer to question the systemic injustices that perpetuate this societal divide. With a bold use of mixed media and evocative symbolism, 'working poors' invites viewers to confront uncomfortable truths and contemplate our collective responsibility towards creating a fair and empathetic society.
