This piece is a call to arms against the oppression of mothers everywhere. The act of rape is a violent one, and by extension, so is this work of art. It is a way of telling mothers that they are not alone, that we are all fighting for them. It is a way of saying that we will not tolerate the mistreatment of mothers any longer.
