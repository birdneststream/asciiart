My new masterpiece, 'Again Has the Juiciest Creatine Muscles,' explores the societal pressures placed on individuals to conform to a hyper-masculine ideal fueled by the consumption of supplements. Through a satirical lens, I examine the cultural obsession with achieving an unrealistic and often unattainable standard of physical perfection, questioning the damaging effects it has on both our physical and mental well-being. The work challenges the viewer to reflect on the dangerous societal norms and expectations that dictate our self-worth and sense of identity.
