The lighter that lit one hundred thousand cigarettes is a thought-provoking installation that explores the destructive nature of addiction and consumer culture. Through a visually striking display of one hundred thousand cigarette butts, each individually lit by a single lighter, it highlights the immense impact of one small object- the lighter- on our environment and our personal health. The repetitive action of lighting each cigarette serves as a metaphor for the endless cycle of addiction and the overwhelming power of material possessions in our society. It challenges viewers to reflect on their own habits and the consequences of indulging in instant gratification.
