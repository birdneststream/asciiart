Chinaboobs is a portrait of a certain type of man: one who is comfortable with his own sexuality and unafraid to show it. His self-confidence is evident in the way he holds himself and in his gaze. The portrait is set against a background of colorful geometric shapes, which represents the chaos and vibrancy of sexual energy. The title refers to a particular act that this man is known for, and which some find disgusting, but which he clearly enjoys. 
The portrait is meant to provoke thought and discussion about sexuality, and to celebrate those who are comfortable with their own desires.
