This is a piece that celebrates the fact that everyone is beautiful in their own way. Whether you have traditionally " masculine " features or not, you are still worthy of love and respect. The drag show is a place where people of all genders and outfit themselves in a range of outrageous and gorgeous costumes, and this painting reflects that diversity. My wife's chest may not fit 
societal norms, but that just makes her even more special and amazing to me.
