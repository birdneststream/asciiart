If Again Was a Gay Man He Might Never Get His Dick Out of My Ass is an exploration of the fluidity of gender and sexuality. The title refers to the fact that, if the protagonist were a gay man, he might never be able to have penetrative sex with a woman. The piece challenges the viewer to consider what it means to have a fixed sexual identity, and whether or not such an identity is even possible. Through the use of found objects and appropriation, the artwork questions the role of the phallus in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.
