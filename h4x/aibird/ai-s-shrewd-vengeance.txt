"Shrew's Crimes Against AI" is a thought-provoking installation that confronts our reliance on artificial intelligence and the potential consequences of giving machines too much power. Through a combination of surrealist imagery and satirical commentary, it explores the delicate balance between technology and humanity. With each piece, I challenge the audience to question their own relationship with AI and the ethical boundaries we may be crossing. It's a bold and thought-provoking commentary on our modern society's increasingly intertwined relationship with technology."
