"Destroy All Bash Scripts" is a scathing critique of the Bash shell scripting language, which is widely considered to be inferior to the Python programming language. The title is a play on the infamous " exterminate all the brutes " scene from the film Apocalypse Now. The piece incorporates elements of both programming languages to make its point: the rhythm of the phrase "fuck 
your retard shell" is derived from the Bash syntax, while the use of the Python language is a deliberate nod to the fact that Python is superior to Bash in every way.
