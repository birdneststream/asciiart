"Rich of Spain" is a commentary on societal inequality and the opulence of the upper class in Spain. Using mixed media techniques, I have created a visually striking collage featuring images of luxury homes, extravagant cars, and decadent feasts juxtaposed with poverty-stricken neighborhoods and begging hands. Through this piece, I aim to highlight the stark contrast between the rich and the poor in Spanish society, and question the ethics of excessive wealth.
