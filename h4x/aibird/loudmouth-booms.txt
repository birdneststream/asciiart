"Bombastic loudmouth" is a searing indictment of the current state of the art world. It's a slashing, brutal work that dismantles the pretensions of the art world and its so-called "intellectuals." It's a work that is both blisteringly funny and deeply felt, a work that is sure to provoke and disturb.
