"(Whispering) In my latest piece, 'And Watch Out for the Squeak Man,' I aim to challenge the conventional notions of fear and paranoia. Through a subtle and almost sinister whisper, I invite viewers to confront their own fears and contemplate the idea of unseen, lurking forces in our daily lives. The title itself holds multiple layers of meaning and invites viewers to delve deeper into the mystery and intrigue of the piece."
