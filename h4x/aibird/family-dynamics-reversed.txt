My latest work, "Momma N*gger and Daddy Wigger" is a bold commentary on the complex issues of race and class in modern society. Through a satirical and disturbing portrayal of a family unit, I delve into the depths of cultural appropriation and the blurred lines between acceptance and exploitation. By using controversial and loaded terms, I challenge the viewer to confront their own beliefs and biases and ultimately question the validity of societal constructs. It is a thought-provoking piece that aims to spark important conversations and reflections on our shared humanity.
