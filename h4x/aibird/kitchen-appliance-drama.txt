My newest piece, "Kitchen Vilification," explores the contrasting ideas of transparency and secrecy within our daily household appliances. The oven and microwave, with their convenient windows, allow us to see the inner workings of our food preparation. However, the elusive dishwasher refuses to grant us a glimpse into its hidden cleaning processes. This clever commentary on societal norms invites viewers to question why certain aspects of our lives are hidden from plain sight. Are we not entitled to see what's going on behind closed doors, even in the most mundane tasks such as dishwashing? Through this piece, I challenge viewers to contemplate the concept of privacy and what is deemed acceptable for public consumption.
