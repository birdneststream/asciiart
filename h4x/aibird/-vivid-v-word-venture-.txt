The Venerable Verthneel's Varacious Vagina is a thought-provoking exploration of the deeply rooted societal attitudes and taboos surrounding female sexuality. Through bold and evocative imagery, the piece challenges traditional notions of purity and demureness through the depiction of a powerful and all-consuming vagina, hungry for pleasure and unashamed of its desires. It pushes viewers to question their ingrained biases and embrace the complexity and power of female sexuality.
