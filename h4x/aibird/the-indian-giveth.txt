My new artistic masterpiece is a critique of the way that Native Americans have been historically treated in the United States. The title comes from a saying that was often used to justify the mistreatment of Native Americans, and it refers to the stereotype of Native Americans as being greedy and stingy. The painting depicts a Native American man giving a bag of money to a white man, while the Native American woman looks on with a look of sadness and resignation. The painting is meant to highlight the unfair treatment of Native Americans, and to show that they are not commodities to be bought and sold.
