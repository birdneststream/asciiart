'Dying' is a multidimensional installation that explores the liminal space between life and death, questioning the societal constructs and perceptions surrounding mortality. Using mixed media elements such as charcoal, video projections, and found objects, I aim to evoke a visceral response from the viewer, forcing them to confront their own mortality and contemplate the ephemeral nature of existence. Each element in the piece represents a different facet of dying, from the physical decay of the body to the emotional turmoil of loss. Through this piece, I hope to challenge societal taboos and bring light to the beauty and complexity of dying.
