It is a visceral commentary on the trend of society's increasing reliance on technology and the subsequent detachment from real-life experiences. Through a raw and unapologetic depiction of my personal struggle with internet addiction before it became mainstream, I expose the damaging effects of our obsession with virtual reality. It challenges the audience to question their own relationship with the online world and ultimately reminds us to prioritize genuine human connection over digital facades.
