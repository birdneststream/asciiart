This is an important work that deals with the complex issues of identity and self-expression. It is a powerful metaphor for the way that we all must come to terms with our own individuality, and how we must ultimately overcome the barriers that we put up between ourselves and others. The five dicks represent the five major social groups that we all identify with, and the ten balls represent the ten major life dilemmas that we all face. The lack of walls represents the fact that we all must learn to open ourselves up to others, and to embrace our differences. This work is a powerful reminder that we are all individuals, and that we all have the power to make a difference in the world.
