My new artwork, "ghost ride the whip", is a commentary on the modern world. The title refers to the popular trend of "ghost riding", where individuals ride on top of cars or other vehicles while they are moving. This trend is often associated with gang activity and street culture. By contrast, my artwork shows a figure riding a whip, which is a tool typically used for horses. This image is meant to signify the way that people in today's society are 
often controlled by forces that they cannot see or understand. The figure riding the whip is ghost-like, representing the way that people are controlled by unseen forces.
