"Nigger sylar and faggot again" is a social commentary on the continued discrimination against blacks and homosexuals in our society. The use of the word "nigger" is meant to shock and provoke, while the word "faggot" is meant to show the audience that even though progress has been made in some areas, there is still a long way to go in terms of equality.
