This work is a comment on the current status of society, and the way that we treat our environment. The bird bones clogging the shopvac hose represent the way that we often ignore the messaging of environmentalism, and the ways that we allow our planet to be polluted. This work is a way to make the viewer think about the state of the world, and the way that we need to change our habits in order to save our planet.
