This piece is a commentary on the often overlooked aspect of the male form- the anus. By stretching it open and giving it a minimum of detailing, I invite the viewer to contemplate the fragility and flexibility of the human body, while also thinking about the hidden functions of the anus and its relationship to the male sexual experience. The work is also a personal reflection on my own experience of anal stretching and the intense pleasure/pain that comes with it.
