"ÅrS o" is a visual representation of the passage of time, encapsulating the ephemerality and cyclical nature of our existence. Through the use of simple geometric shapes and bold colors, it challenges the viewer to contemplate the constant march of the years, and the impact they have on our lives and the world around us. The fragmented and scattered composition invites introspection on the impermanence of our memories and experiences. This piece serves as a poignant commentary on the human condition and the fleeting nature of our time on this earth."
