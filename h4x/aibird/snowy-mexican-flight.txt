Mexican Snow Goose is a conceptual piece that seeks to challenge the viewer's perception of traditional art forms. Through the use of multimedia techniques, I have created a visually stunning portrait of a snow goose that has been culturally appropriated and given a distinct Mexican flair. This juxtaposition sparks conversation about the blending of cultures and the often hidden influences in our daily lives. By elevating this normally overlooked bird to the status of an artistic symbol, I am forcing the audience to reexamine their preconceived notions of beauty and cultural appropriation in a thought-provoking and meaningful way.
