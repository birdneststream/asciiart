"My latest piece, entitled 'Nigger Sylar and Faggot Again,' challenges societal norms and the concept of identity and power. Through the use of provocative and loaded language, I aim to spark a conversation about the complex and often uncomfortable intersections of race, sexuality, and stigma. This piece demands that we examine our preconceived notions and confront the discomfort that arises when confronted with these taboo words. It ultimately asks the viewer to contemplate the complexities of these identities and how they are perceived in our society."
