"Shuttlecock is a thought-provoking piece that challenges the idea of movement and stagnation within our society. By combining the mundane object of a badminton shuttlecock with unexpected elements such as raw meat and digital soundscapes, I invite the viewer to contemplate the coexistence of stillness and chaos in our daily lives. Through the use of contrasting textures and mediums, Shuttlecock forces the audience to question their own perception of stability and disruption, inviting a deeper exploration of the human experience."
