This artwork is a commentary on the double standards that exist in society when it comes to homosexuality. It seems that in many cases, people are quick to judge and criticize homosexuality, while at the same time being much more tolerant of other sexual orientations. This artwork seeks to challenge those double standards by imagining what it would be like if heterosexuality was treated in the same way that homosexuality is currently treated. In other words, if being gay was seen as something shameful or disgusting, then straight people might never be able to have sex without feeling guilty or ashamed. This artwork is a way of saying that homophobia is ultimately hypocritical and ridiculous.
