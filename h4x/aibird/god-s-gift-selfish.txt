This piece explores the complex and contradictory nature of male bodies and the societal pressures placed upon them. The central figure, Again, is depicted as a gift from a divine power, yet his selfishness and refusal to participate in the objectification of his body challenges the audience's perception of what it means to be a desirable and successful man. Through this work, I invite viewers to reflect on the damaging effects of a hypersexualized culture and question the sacrifices individuals make for external validation.
