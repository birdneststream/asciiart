This artpiece is a social commentary on the dangers of cybernetic enhancements. The large, fake breasts on the figure of 'Uncle Chinaboobs' represent the over-inflated egos of those who have had surgery to inflate their own breasts. The fact that he is knocking people over with his giant fake breasts represents the way that these people often times take advantage of others, using their enhanced body parts to get what they want. This piece is meant 
to warn people of the dangers of plastic surgery and the like, and to show that sometimes, bigger is not always better.
