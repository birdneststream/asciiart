This piece is a commentary on the societal suppression and erasure of marginalized individuals, specifically in the context of historical slavery. By portraying a hidden slave underneath a lavish carpet in an affluent living room, it highlights the way in which these oppressive systems are often concealed and ignored by the privileged class. The use of the term "back" suggests a cyclical nature of this oppression, where it continues to resurface despite attempts to bury it. This piece challenges viewers to confront and dismantle these systems of exploitation and privilege.
