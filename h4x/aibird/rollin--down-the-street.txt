This work is a commentary on the effects of capitalism and consumer culture on the working class. The title refers to the iconic image of the lowrider car, which is often associated with gang culture and violence. The car is representative of the material possessions that are coveted by the working class, but which are out of reach for many. The use of drugs and alcohol is also 
a common coping mechanism for those who are struggling to make ends meet. The phrase "sippin on gin and jews" refers to the stereotype of Jewish people as being rich and greedy. This work is meant to challenge the notion that money is the only thing that matters in life.
