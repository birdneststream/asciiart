'56 Impaled on a Stake' is a provocative and daring commentary on the commodification and exploitation of human suffering in our contemporary society. Using the visceral imagery of a yearning human body skewered on a stake, the piece challenges the audience to confront their own desensitization and voyeurism towards violence and tragedy. Through this bold and thought-provoking work, I compel the viewer to question their own complicity in perpetuating a culture of indifference and superficial sensationalism.
