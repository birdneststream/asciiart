This work is a response to the current refugee crisis in Europe. It is a call to action to adopt a refugee, specifically a large dicked Russian war refugee. The image is of a young man, with a large penis, standing in front of a map of Europe. He is shirtless and barefoot, with a look of resignation on his face. The message of the piece is that we need to do something to help these refugees, and that adopting one could make a difference in their lives.
