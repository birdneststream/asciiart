This is an abstract expressionist painting that explores the exploitation of working mothers in our society. The mother figure is represented by the breasts, which are being milked by corporate CEOs. The lack of time mothers have to spend with their children is represented by the short duration of the milk-feeding. This painting is a comment on the unfair treatment of mothers in the workforce, and the ways in which they are exploited for their productivity.
