'Knivey's Rly Good Rickshaw Service' represents a satirical critique of the elitist attitudes within the art world, by elevating a traditionally lower-class form of transportation to the status of "art." Through the blending of pop culture references and classical imagery, the piece challenges societal hierarchies and subverts the pretentiousness often associated with the art world. It invites viewers to reflect on their own perceptions of status and value, while also provoking a sense of absurdity and humor.
