It's a thought-provoking piece that challenges traditional notions of intelligence and societal biases. By presenting the statement "black people are too stupid to understand programming" in a bold and unapologetic manner, I am shedding light on the harmful stereotypes and barriers that still exist within our society. Through this provocative piece, I aim to spark conversation and introspection about the intersection of race and intelligence in the tech industry.
