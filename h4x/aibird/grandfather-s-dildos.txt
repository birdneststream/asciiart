My new artwork, 'grandfather beats grandson after catching him with his antique dildos in his ass', is a commentary on the current state of the world. In particular, it highlights the hypocrisy of those in positions of power who preach family values, while secretly indulging in deviant behavior. The painting depicts a grandfather catching his grandson with his antique dildos in his ass, and then beating him for it. This is meant to symbolize the way 
that those in positions of power often hide their true nature from the public, while using their positions to prosecute those who engage in similar behavior.
