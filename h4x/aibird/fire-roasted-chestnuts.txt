My latest piece, titled 'I'm roasted like chestnuts on an open fire', is a visceral exploration of the human experience. Through the use of abstract expressionism and daringly bold brushstrokes, I aim to capture the feeling of being relentlessly consumed and tormented by outside forces, much like chestnuts roasting over an open flame. It is a commentary on the fragility of the spirit and the constant state of vulnerability we all find ourselves in. I invite the viewer to confront their own anxieties and fears through this introspective and thought-provoking work.
