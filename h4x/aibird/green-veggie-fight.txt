'Broccoli or cauliflower' is a thought-provoking piece that challenges our preconceived notions of identity and choice. Through the simple yet dynamic compositions of these two vegetables, I present a metaphor for the dichotomy of self and society. The contrasting colors and textures of broccoli and cauliflower represent the complexities and conflicts within ourselves, while also serving as a commentary on the societal pressure to conform and choose one path over another. It is a commentary on the limitations of choice and the inevitability of being categorized, and encourages introspection and reflection on our own personal journeys.
