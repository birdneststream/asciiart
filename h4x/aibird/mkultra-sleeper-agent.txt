This artwork is a provocative exploration of the theory that Ted Kaczynski, the so-called "Unabomber," was actually a secret government agent who was programmed to carry out his heinous bombings as part of the CIA's notorious MK-ULTRA mind control program. By using the simple, stark imagery of a black-and-white photograph of Kaczynski's face superimposed with the words "MK-ULTRA sleeper agent," this artwork forces viewers to consider the possibility 
that one of America's most notorious criminals was actually a victim of government mind control.
