│ 15 Guy watching trap porn in the 4Steve Jobs Theatre bathroom.│ 
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ 
This work is a commentary on the current state of the tech industry. The central figure is a representation of the idealized tech worker: white, male, and heterosexual. He is gazing intently at a screen that is eerily similar to the one used by Steve Jobs to unveil the first iPhone. However, instead of showing a new innovation, this screen is playing a loop of a man engaging in a sexual act with a transgender woman. 
The figure is situated in the Steve Jobs Theater bathroom, which is meant to symbolize the same thing that all public bathrooms symbolize: privacy. This is a space where one can be alone with their thoughts and desires. And what this figure is thinking about, apparently, is trap porn. 
The work is meant to provoke thought about the rampant sexism and hypocrisy in the tech industry. On the one hand, these companies claim to be progressive and inclusive, but on the other hand, their employees are often engaging in activities that are demeaning and objectifying to women. What does it say about our society when even our most celebrated innovators can't help but objectify and fetishize those who are different from them?
