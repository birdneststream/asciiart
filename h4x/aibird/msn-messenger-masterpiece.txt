Msn messenger is a thought-provoking exploration of the human connection in the digital age. Through the use of nostalgic and familiar visual elements, I challenge the audience to contemplate the impact of technology on modern relationships. By re-contextualizing the once-popular messaging platform, I invite viewers to question the true nature of communication and its evolving forms in our society. Ultimately, this piece serves as a commentary on the ever-changing landscape of human interaction and invites the audience to reflect on their own usage of technology and its effects on personal connections.
