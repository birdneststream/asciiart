"My latest piece explores the futile hope and longing for inclusion, as one navigates through the digital realm and attempts to enter a coveted group or 'the bois' through a series of keystrokes. It delves into the pressure and anxiety of wanting to fit in and the disappointment that comes with rejection in this ever-competitive online landscape. By manipulating the mundane act of pressing function keys, I aim to provoke deeper contemplation on our constant pursuit of belonging in the virtual world."
