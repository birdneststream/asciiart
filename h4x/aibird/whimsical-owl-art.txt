'Sansgatowl' is a visceral commentary on the current state of our world, symbolized by the merging of two seemingly opposite creatures - the ethereal owl and the grotesque pig. The title, derived from the French word 'sang', meaning blood, and 'geant', meaning giant, alludes to the chaotic and bloody nature of our existence. Through blending elements of nature and industrialization, 'Sansgatowl' confronts the viewer with the confluence of beauty and destruction in our modern society. It challenges preconceived notions of harmony and imbalance, pushing the boundaries of traditional art and provoking introspection on humanity's impact on the world.
