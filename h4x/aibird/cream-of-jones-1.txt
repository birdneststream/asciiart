Cream of Jones is a work that explores the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality. It is a metaphor for the way that these social constructs interact with and oppress one another. The title refers to the fact that, just like cream, these social constructs are sticky and difficult to escape from. The work consists of a series of images that show different aspects of these intersections. The first image is of a black woman's face, superimposed over a map of the United States. This represents the way that black women are often invisible in mainstream society. The second image is of a transgender woman of color, surrounded by a halo of light. This represents the strength and resilience of transgender women of color in the face of discrimination. The third image is of a queer femme couple kissing, surrounded by a ring of fire. This represents the passion and love that queer femmes have for one another, despite the odds.
