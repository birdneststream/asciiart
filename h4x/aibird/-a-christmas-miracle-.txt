This piece is a statement on the societal issue of racism. It highlights the double standard that exists when black people are forced to celebrate a holiday that is not their own. The black dye represents the exclusion and discrimination that black people face on a daily basis. The fact that it is raining black dye on Chicago, a city that is majority black, is a powerful statement 
on how racism is still a very real problem in our society. By finally allowing black families to have ethnic snowmen, we are recognizing their right to celebrate their own culture and traditions. This piece is a call to action for us to come together and end racism once and for all.
