This work is a departure from my earlier, more traditional portraiture. It is a more psychological study of the human condition. The subject is my uncle, who has always been a bit of an eccentric. I wanted to capture the oddity of his persona in this painting. The title refers to his rather unusual anatomy; he is quite wellendowed in that area.
