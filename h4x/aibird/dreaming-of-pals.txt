'Goodnight Chat Pals' is a visceral representation of the deep connections we often form with strangers in digital spaces. Through the use of abstract shapes and vibrant colors, I explore the sense of community that emerges from late night conversations with people we may never meet in person. This piece challenges the traditional definitions of friendship and prompts reflection on the impact of technology on modern relationships. It encapsulates the beauty and complexity of our online interactions, inviting the viewer to question what it truly means to say "goodnight" to our chat pals.
