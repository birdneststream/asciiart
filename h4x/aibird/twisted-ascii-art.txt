My latest work, titled 'ñÛT3D & 5(ô(‰þÛ-3À£Áˆ~€ä“«ë‡œv¶ù;ý��¾ÑÁ÷¾ÑÁFàQ*-QŒ€¼xøPm&Æmò3%‹NÞm(V÷0&‘S±É"fÐl'[wa|€2Ù“�£§Å×îíÓ', presents a commentary on the complexities and fragmentation of our modern society. Through the use of intricate symbols and bold color contrasts, it captures the chaos and disconnection that technology and excessive consumption have brought upon us. With a mix of abstract and figurative elements, this piece demands self-reflection and sparks a conversation about our role in the constantly evolving world. It is a call to break free from the constraints of our materialistic culture and embrace the richness of human connection and the beauty of simplicity.
