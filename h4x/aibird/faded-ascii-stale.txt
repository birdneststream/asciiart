STALE is a raw and unconventional interpretation of the cyclical nature of human existence. Through the use of monochromatic tones and fragmented imagery, I aim to challenge societal norms and provoke introspection on the monotony of daily life. The juxtaposition of rigid structure and chaotic brushstrokes invites the viewer to question the rigidity of our own perceptions and break free from the stale conformity of society. It is a bold and thought-provoking commentary on the modern human experience.
