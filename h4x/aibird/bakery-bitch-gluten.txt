This piece is a scathing commentary on our society's unhealthy obsession with processed, gluten-laden foods. Through the use of dark humor and ironic juxtaposition, I aim to challenge the viewer to question the ethics and consequences of blindly indulging in toxic substances. By showcasing the titular "bakery bitch" as the main purveyor of this poison, I am exposing the corruption and greed within the food industry. It is a stark reminder of the power dynamics at play and the nefarious agendas behind our everyday choices.
