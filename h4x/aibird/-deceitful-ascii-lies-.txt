"Lies" is a thought-provoking piece that challenges our perceptions of truth and deception. Through a combination of minimalist shapes and bold colors, it begs the question: what is real and what is fabricated? The ambiguity of the piece invites the viewer to contemplate the role of lies in our society and how easily they can become accepted as truth. It is a commentary on the power of deception and the fragility of our supposed reality.
