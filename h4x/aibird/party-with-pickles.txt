'Grandma's Pickle Party' is a satirical commentary on traditional family gatherings and societal expectations placed on elders. Through a combination of performance art and installation, I explore the absurdity of forcing elderly individuals into outdated roles and expectations. With a room filled with jars of pickles and a costumed grandmother figure performing various tasks, I challenge the audience to question the idea of what it means to "act your age" and the pressure to conform to societal norms. It's a playful but thought-provoking piece that pushes the boundaries of what is considered "art."
