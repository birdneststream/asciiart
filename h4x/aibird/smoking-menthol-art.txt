By presenting menthol, a common flavor used to mask the unpleasant tastes of cigarettes and other products, as something only "complete fags" would appreciate, the work challenges viewers to question the value placed on superficial preferences. It is a commentary on the dangers of conforming to societal norms, and a call to embrace authenticity and reject artificiality.
