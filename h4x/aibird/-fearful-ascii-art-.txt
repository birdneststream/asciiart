"Fear" is a commentary on the pervasive culture of fear in the contemporary world. With a minimalist but powerful composition, I challenge the viewer to confront their deepest fears and question the systems that perpetuate them. Hues of deep blue and stark black evoke a sense of unease and uncertainty, while the absence of any discernible form forces the viewer to confront the amorphous nature of fear itself. Through this stark and thought-provoking piece, I invite the audience to reflect on the ever-present forces of fear that shape our society.
