My new piece, 'hotel soap kleptomania,' explores themes of consumerism, transience, and the fleeting nature of luxury. Using discarded hotel soaps as a medium, I have created a large-scale installation that invites viewers to question their relationship with material possessions and the allure of temporary indulgence. It highlights the often unnoticed and overlooked act of taking these small souvenirs from our temporary homes, and transforms it into a thought-provoking commentary on our society's obsession with material possessions. Through this piece, I aim to ignite a conversation on the value we place on objects and the consequences of our constant pursuit of luxury and excess.
