My new artistic masterpiece, "Poor One Out for the Homies Who Died Before They Could Finish Watching Planetes," is a poignant and thought-provoking exploration of the fragility of life and the impact of unfinished experiences. Through a striking visual display, I honor those who have passed on before having the opportunity to complete their viewing of the beloved anime, Planetes. With elements of grief, nostalgia, and a celebration of the joys of shared media, this piece challenges viewers to reflect on the fleeting nature of our existence and the importance of cherishing every moment.
