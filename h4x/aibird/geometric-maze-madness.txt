My new artistic masterpiece '▛▟▛▜▛▜▟' is a visual representation of the fragmented and chaotic nature of our society. The contrasting shapes and disjointed lines depict the disconnect and disarray in our daily lives. It is a reflection of the constant inundation of information and fragmentary pieces of our identities, ultimately resulting in a sense of dissonance and confusion. Through this unconventional composition, I aim to challenge the viewer to question the state of our society and their place within it.
