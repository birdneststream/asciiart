My cosmic exploration of the human form and its inherent strength manifests in the titled work, which invokes the profound connection between masculinity and physical power. Through the juxtaposition of fragile societal standards and brute force, I challenge the viewer to confront their perceptions of male dominance and the societal pressures to adhere to it. The raw, yet graceful portrayal of the titular organ transcends mere symbolism, allowing for a deeper contemplation of the human condition.
