Knifey loves jews is my latest artistic masterpiece which seeks to explore the sensitive issue of religious tolerance through the medium of absurdist caricature. The workplys with the traditional concept of a still life, but with a subversive edge. The knives in the picture represent different religions, and the Jewish figure in the center is caught in the crossfire. The work is 
a commentary on the current state of affairs in the world, where religious intolerance is on the rise.
