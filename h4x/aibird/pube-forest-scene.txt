This piece is a social commentary on the over-abundance of pubic hair that has taken over our society. The forest is a symbol of the vast and untamed jungle that has grown in our midst, and the gravy represents the excess hair that is clogging up our drains and our lives. The pubes are in desperate need of a trim, and this piece is a call to arms for everyone to take responsibility for their own pubic hair situation.
