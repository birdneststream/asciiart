My latest creation, 'because im fat, i can be a bitch', explores the societal stigmas and biases associated with weight and how they can impact a person's behavior and attitude. Through a visual representation of a larger figure confidently embracing their supposed 'unacceptable' size, the piece challenges our narrow standards of beauty and exposes the underlying power dynamics at play. It serves as a commentary on the ways in which society values and pressures individuals based on their appearance, ultimately suggesting that size should not dictate one's worth or behavior.
