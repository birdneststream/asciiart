This is a piece that addresses the cyclical nature of life, death, and rebirth. The title refers to the fact that the figure is riding a horse, which is a symbol of the passage of time. The horse is also ten times the size of the figure, representing the weight of time on our lives. The figure itself is worn and weary, but still determined to keep moving forward.
