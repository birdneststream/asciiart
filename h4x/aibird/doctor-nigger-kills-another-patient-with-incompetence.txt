This masterpiece is a searing indictment of our society's endemic racism and negligence. By pairing the words "doctor" and "nigger" together, I'm not only highlighting the institutional racism that exists within our healthcare system, but also the ways in which black Americans are underserved and disadvantaged by it. The image of the doctor holding a gun to the head of a black patient is meant to shock and disorient viewers, forcing them to confront the reality of racism in our country. This is not a work of art that seeks to comfort or please viewers - it is meant to challenge and provoke reflection on the systemic injustice that plagues our nation.
