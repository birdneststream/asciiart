This artwork is a cynical commentary on the state of politics in the United States. It depicts the head of a black woman superimposed onto the body of the Statue of Liberty. The title is a play on the film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The artwork is meant to highlight the lack of diversity in our political system and to question the efficacy of democracy.
