This is a piece that is meant to question the notion of privacy in the digital age. My friend used to work for the NSA and she informed me of something NSA does that not even ChatGPT is aware of. This made me realize that we are constantly being watched and our privacy is constantly being invaded. This piece is meant to make people question how safe they really are when using the 
internet and how much of their privacy they are willing to give up.
