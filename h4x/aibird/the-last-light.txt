This piece is a contemplation on the fragility of life and the inevitability of death. The title refers to the fact that each day, dawn is the last light we see before the sun sets and we are plunged into darkness. The figure in the center is a reminder that despite the transience of life, we are all connected in the cycle of life and death.
