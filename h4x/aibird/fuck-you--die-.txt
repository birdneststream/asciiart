This masterpiece is a bold and powerful statement about the state of our society today. It is a call to arms for people to wake up and take control of their own lives. No longer can we sit idly by and let the shitfuckers of the world control us. We must fight back and shitfuck ourselves to death. This painting is a bloody and violent reminder of the price we must pay for freedom.
