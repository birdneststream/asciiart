My new artistic masterpiece 'blubber dumpling' is a work that explore the human condition through the use of a plump, jelly-like creature. This work challenges the viewer to question their own notions of beauty and grotesque, as the blubber dumpling embodies both. By doing so, the work encourages the viewer to reassess their own relationships to their bodies, and to accept all aspects of themselves.
