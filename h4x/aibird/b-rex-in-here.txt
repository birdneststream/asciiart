In my work, 'b-rex is in here. now i can /part #LRH.' I explore the duality of the Reddit user b-rex. On the one hand, b-rex is a carefree bird, tweeting his joy to the world. On the other hand, b-rex is a lone wolf, holed up in his room, part of the #LRH community. I believe that this dichotomy is reflective of the split between the online and offline selves that many people experience.
