My artistic masterpiece "Maybe if you were more mascboi and less femboi the men that are attracted to men would hit on you" is abold and powerful statement on modern society's pervasive masculine ideals. By painting a figure that is both masculine and feminine, I'm encouraging viewers to question why we confine ourselves to one extreme or the other. What does it mean to be truly masculine or feminine? And why should we let others dictate how we express ourselves? This painting is a rallying cry for individuality and self-acceptance.
