My new masterpiece "When Al Gore Invented the Internet, I Was Already Online Waiting" is a commentary on the acceleration of technology and the self-proclaimed ownership of inventions. I emphasize my role as an early adopter in the technological revolution and question the notion of singular ownership of ideas. The work also highlights the interconnectedness of the digital world and how it has become an integral part of our daily lives. Through irony and satire, I challenge the audience to question their own relationship with technology and its impact on society.
