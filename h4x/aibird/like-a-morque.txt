My new artistic masterpiece 'like a morque' is a modern take on the classic still life genre. I have used a range of different mediums to create a multi-dimensional effect that references the traditional art form while also incorporating a contemporary twist. 
The title of the piece refers to the French word for 'dead', which is fitting given the subject matter. The work features a variety of objects that have been dead for many years, including a skeleton, a skull and a number of bones. These items have been arranged in a way that pays homage to the classic still life paintings of the past. 
However, unlike those traditional pieces, my work also includes a range of modern elements. These include a background of cityscape photography, as well as a number of graphic elements that have been overlayed onto the image. This gives the piece a unique and contemporary feel. 
I believe that 'like a morque' is a successful fusion of traditional and modern art that will appeal to a wide range of viewers.
