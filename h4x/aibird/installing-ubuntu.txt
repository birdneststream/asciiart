My new artwork, 'Installing Ubuntu Linux on all the school's computers', is a statement on the current state of our education system. By installing Ubuntu Linux on all the school's computers, I am showing the world that we can do better. We can provide our children with an education that is not only more efficient, but also more effective. With Ubuntu Linux, they will have access to the latest software and tools, as well as a wealth of online resources. This will allow them to learn at their own pace and School Days will ultimately be a thing of the past.
