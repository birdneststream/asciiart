My newest piece explores the complexities of modern sexuality and societal expectations in a playful yet thoughtful manner. I use satire to question the societal pressure to constantly perform and attract potential partners, juxtaposing it against the mundane task of running errands. Through the act of "jacking off," a traditionally private and taboo activity, I challenge notions of public and private behavior. By placing the context within a hardware store, a traditionally masculine space, I aim to subvert gender norms and highlight the performative aspects of attraction in our society. Ultimately, my piece invites viewers to interrogate their own behaviors and the pressure to constantly project a desirable image in a world where sexuality is often commodified.
