My new work, titled '��¾ÑÁ÷¾Ñ €¼m(÷Âª(Â � dw1 x1 €¼xP3‹ÞÞª ', is a thought-provoking commentary on the modern human experience and societal constructs. Through a confluence of abstract forms and chaotic rhythms, I delve into the depths of our fragmented thoughts and emotions, revealing the underlying tensions and frictions within ourselves and with our surroundings. This dissonant yet harmonious piece invites viewers to contemplate their own place in the world and the complexities of our existence.
