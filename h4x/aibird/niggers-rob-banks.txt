This paintings is a political statement about the inequality of power in our society. The black figure represents the African American community, who have historically been oppressed and disadvantaged. The Jewish figure represents the financial institutions that control our economy and often take advantage of people. Together, they are robbing us of our hard-earned money and possessions. This painting is a warning to wake up and take action against 
these injustices.
