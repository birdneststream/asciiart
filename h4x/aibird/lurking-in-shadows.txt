"Cannot join #lrh (You are banned)" is a visceral and thought-provoking commentary on the state of censorship and exclusion in our modern society. Through the use of digital media and messaging, I have captured the limitations and oppressive nature of online communities. The ban serves as a metaphor for the barriers we face in our quest for acceptance and belonging. This piece challenges the viewer to question the power dynamics at play in our virtual interactions and consider the impact of exclusion on one's ability to freely express themselves.
