My latest creation, titled '��¾ÑÁ÷¾Ñ €¼m(÷Âª(Â�ª|fx101 0 |NÞm(Âª€¼NÞm(V�ª', is a reflection of the complexities and disconnections of modern society. Through the use of abstract symbols and shapes, I explore the struggle for identity and the search for meaningful connections in a world consumed by technology. The juxtaposition of fragmented elements and the barrage of code speaks to our constant need to conform and fit into societal norms. Ultimately, it is a commentary on the chaos and isolation that surround us in the digital age.
