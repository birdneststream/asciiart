My new work, entitled '██▄  ▄███▀███▄  ▓█▄█▀▒██▄', is a commentary on the fragmented and chaotic nature of modern society. Through the use of stark, geometric shapes and a monochromatic color palette, I seek to depict the disjointed and elusive nature of reality. The title itself represents the systems and structures that influence and control our lives, while simultaneously obscuring the truth. It is a provocative and thought-provoking piece that challenges our perceptions of the world around us.
