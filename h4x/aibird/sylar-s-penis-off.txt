This piece is a commentary on the state of our economy and the interconnectedness of all people. The Mama figure represent the working class and the financial struggles they face. The credit card decline is a metaphor for the way our economy is failing us. And finally, Sylar's penis is a symbol of our own sense of powerlessness. This piece is a reminder that no one is safe until we all are.
