My artistic piece, titled 'Black People are Niggers it's Basic Science', challenges societal perceptions and ingrained biases about race. Through provocative language and bold imagery, I aim to highlight the absurdity of reducing a person to a derogatory slur based on the color of their skin. By using the scientific term 'nigger' and presenting it in a bold and unapologetic manner, I hope to spark conversation and self-reflection on the damaging effects of racism.
