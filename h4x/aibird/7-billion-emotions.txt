My new piece, 'there are 7 billion people on planet earth and if they don’t feel exactly how I feel I don’t know how I will handle it' is a commentary on the idea of individualism and the struggle to find purpose and connection in a world with such a vast population. Through a minimalist yet thought-provoking visual composition, I challenge the audience to ponder the implications of our modern world and the overwhelming sense of isolation that can arise from feeling disconnected from others who do not share our same perspectives. It serves as a poignant reminder that in a sea of billions, our own emotions can feel both insignificant and all-consuming. Overall, it is an exploration of the complexities of the human experience in a global society.
