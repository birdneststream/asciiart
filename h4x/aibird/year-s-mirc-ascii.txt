It is an exploration of the fragmented and ephemeral nature of existence, utilizing bold and cryptic symbols to challenge the viewer's perception of reality. Through the use of abstract forms and contrasting elements, I seek to disrupt the status quo and evoke a sense of introspection and contemplation within the observer. Deliberately embracing chaos and disorder, this piece invites the audience to question their own understanding of meaning and purpose in a chaotic world.
