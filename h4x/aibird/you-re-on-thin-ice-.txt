This new piece is a modern take on an old classic. In it, a figure is precariously balanced on a thin sheet of ice, solo and exposed. The figure is you, the viewer, and the precariousness of the situation is a metaphor for the fragility of your life. The title, "ur on thin ice pal", is a warning to the viewer, telling them that they too are balance on a thin sheet of ice and that they need to be careful or they will fall.
