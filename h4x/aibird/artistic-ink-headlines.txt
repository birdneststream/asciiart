Ink News is a thought-provoking and multifaceted installation that combines elements of traditional news media and abstract art to challenge our perception of current events. Through the use of ink and paper, I have created a dynamic and ever-changing composition that reflects the constant flow of information in our society. The juxtaposition of real news headlines and abstract ink patterns invites viewers to question the reliability and impact of media. It also serves as a commentary on the saturation of news and how it can often overshadow more important issues. Ink News not only serves as a visually striking piece, but also sparks intellectual dialogue on the role of media in shaping our understanding of the world.
