"™y is a meta-commentary on the commercialization of art and symbolizes society's addiction to brands and trademarks. By using the trademark symbol as the main focal point, I am challenging the viewer to question the blurred lines between art and commerce in our modern world. Through a minimalistic approach and bold use of typography, ™y highlights the saturation of branding in our daily lives and sparks a dialogue on the true value of artistic expression."
