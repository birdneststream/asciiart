This erotic piece explores the intersection of human and cephalopod desire. The figure is highly aroused, their body flush with want, as they reach out to touch the octopus tentacles that surround them. The tentacles are equally as desirous, curling around the figure in a passionate embrace. The two forms are locked in a dance of mutual longing, their movements echoing the ebb and flow of desire.
This piece is about the pure, unbridled passion that can exist between two creatures that are seemingly so different. It is a celebration of difference, and a reminder that even the most unlikely of unions can be deeply erotic and satisfying.
