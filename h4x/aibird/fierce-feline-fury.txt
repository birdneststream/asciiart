"Tiger Shooting is a thought-provoking exploration of the complex relationship between human and animal. Through a striking visual composition, the piece forces viewers to confront their own complicit role in the destruction of our natural world. By placing the predatory and endangered tiger in the crosshairs of a loaded gun, I am challenging societal norms and asking audiences to question their inherent desire to dominate and control nature. The stunning contrast of beauty and brutality invites a deeper reflection on our reckless actions as a species. It is a powerful condemnation of our destructive impact on the planet, elevated through the medium of art."
