'hippos u are here < return to canada >' is a conceptual artwork that explores the themes of displacement, identity, and national borders. This large-scale installation features a life-size map of Canada with a group of hippopotamuses placed within it. The choice of hippopotamuses as the subject of this artwork is a commentary on the displacement of animals in their natural habitats due to human activity.
The use of a map of Canada represents the geographical and political boundaries that separate people and ideas. By placing the hippopotamuses within these boundaries, it challenges the traditional notion of national identity and encourages the viewer to question their own sense of belonging.
The chaotic and disorganized placement of the hippopotamuses within the map symbolizes the uncertain and ever-changing nature of national borders and the impact it has on individuals and societies. The title 'hippos u are here < return to canada >' further highlights this idea, suggesting that even after being displaced, there is always a longing to return to one's roots and find a sense of home.
Overall, this artwork invites the viewer to reflect on the complex and often arbitrary concepts of borders, displacement, and identity, and their impact on both humans and animals.
