My newest artistic creation, "We Been Using Correlle for 50 Years Now and Don't Plan on Stopping," explores the unbreakable bond of family through the familiarity of our everyday objects. Through the use of the durable and reliable Correlle plates, I draw attention to the longevity and strength of family relationships. Inspired by the wise words of a pastor, the phrase "the family that eats together stays together" is embodied in the unbreakable nature of the Correlle plates. As a society, we often place value on novelty and constantly seeking the newest and trendiest items, but this piece serves as a reminder that sometimes, the tried and true objects in our lives hold the most meaningful and lasting connections. Just as Correlle plates have stood the test of time, so have family bonds - a testament to the enduring power and beauty of family.
