This artwork is a representation of the dangers of our modern capitalist society. Our protagonist, skg, is thrust into a world where he is constantly bombarded with ads and messages telling him to consume more and more. Eventually, skg is so consumed by the desire to consume that he loses sight of what is important in life. In a tragic moment of loneliness and desperation, skg tries to fill the emptiness inside him by sticking his dick into a shopvac. Unfortunately, the only thing that results from this is the "foomp" sound, which symbolizes the emptiness of skg's action. This work is a warning to us all to be careful of what we consume, lest we end up like skg, with nothing but a "foomp" to show for it.
