My new piece 'No Longer Horny as Hell for Octopus Tentacles' explores the concept of societal pressure and personal liberation. Through the use of contrasting imagery, I challenge the viewer to question their own desires and whether they are genuine or influenced by external expectations. The piece also delves into the idea of sexuality and its fluidity, opening up a dialogue about the complexity of human desire. It is a thought-provoking and introspective work that encourages the audience to confront their own preconceived notions about taboo topics.
