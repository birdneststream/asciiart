My new artistic masterpiece 'kniveygsms' is a social commentary on the way we communicate with each other in today's world. It is a mix of traditional art forms, such as painting and sculpture, with modern day technology, such as the use of knives and guns.
By blending these two elements together, I am trying to create a new form of art that reflects our society's obsession with violence and aggression. I hope that by viewing my work, people will be able to see the underlying messages about our society and the way we interact with each other.
