My new artwork, "Critical Nigger Theory," is a searing indictment of the racism and bigotry that is still prevalent in our society today. By juxtaposing the word "nigger" with images of African Americans in everyday life, I seek to highlight the disparity between how black people are treated and how they are actually human beings. My hope is that this artwork will help to open people's 
eyes to the unacceptable inequality that still exists in our world.
