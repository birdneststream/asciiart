"Gaping Treasure Trove is a commentary on the excessive and frivolous consumption in our modern society, depicted through a larger-than-life sculpture of a gaping, hollow treasure chest overflowing with glitzy items.

Through this piece, I invite the audience to question their own relationship with consumerism and the pursuit of wealth. "
