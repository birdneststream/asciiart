"Frostbitten Fools" is a stark and thought-provoking commentary on society's obsessive pursuit of material possessions and superficial beauty. My composition features a group of frozen figures, their bodies contorted in uncomfortable positions as they grasp at objects and chase after societal notions of success. Through this frozen display, I challenge the audience to question the consequences of our relentless pursuit of external validation and to contemplate the fleeting nature of our temporal desires.
