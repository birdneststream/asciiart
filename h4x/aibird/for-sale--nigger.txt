This is a powerful work that challenges our perceptions of value and worth. By juxtaposing the image of a black man with that of a60, 
window, the viewer is forced to confront the ways in which our society values black lives less than material possessions. The title adds another layer of meaning, cynically suggesting that the black man is nothing more than a commodity to be bought and sold. In this way, the piece addresses the systemic racism that continues to plague our country.
