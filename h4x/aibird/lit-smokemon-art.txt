'Smokemon gotta Smoke em all!' is a satirical commentary on society's obsession with consumerism and instant gratification. Through the use of commercialized images and slogans, the piece explores our never-ending craving for more, represented by the addictive nature of smoking and the popular catchphrase of the Pok√©mon franchise. It challenges viewers to question their own patterns of consumption and the true cost of constantly chasing after the next "gotta-have-it" sensation.
