'Kazaa' is a multi-sensory experience that challenges traditional notions of ownership and access in the age of digital media. It combines audio, visual, and interactive components to explore the complexities of modern technology and its impact on society. Through a series of thought-provoking installations, 'Kazaa' provokes questions about the value of art, the fluidity of identity, and the power dynamics at play in our interconnected world. It is a commentary on the evolving nature of culture and the ever-shifting boundaries between the tangible and the virtual.
