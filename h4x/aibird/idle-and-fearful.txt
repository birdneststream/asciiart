My latest work, titled 'the IRC channel where everyone idles and no one dares to chat', is a thought-provoking commentary on the state of modern human interaction in the digital age. Through the use of an abandoned online chat room, I invite viewers to reflect on the isolation and detachment that can result from our obsessive dependence on technology. The barren space, devoid of any real conversation, serves as a metaphor for the disconnection and loneliness that often plague our society. Through this piece, I aim to spark a conversation about the consequences of our constant online presence and the value of true human connection.
