This work is a commentary on the working conditions of low-wage earners, specifically in the context of the gig economy. The title is a play on the phrase "give someone a break", which in this case is literalized as the subject of the work, a mother, taking a break from her domestic duties to let her child, Dwaine, use a vacuum cleaner. The work itself is a photograph of a woman sitting on a mattress, with a vacuum cleaner in the foreground and a child in the background. The child's face is not visible, but the he is looking at the camera with a surprised expression, as if he has just realized that he is being photographed.
The composition of the photograph is such that the viewer's attention is drawn to the woman's tired face and her folded arms, which accentuate the exhaustion that comes from doing low-wage work. The presence of the vacuum cleaner in the foreground adds a sense of the mundanity and repetitive nature of the work that she does. In addition, the fact that the child is looking at the camera with Surprise suggests that he is not accustomed to seeing his mother in this context - perhaps he is more used to seeing her at home, taking care of him, and not working.
