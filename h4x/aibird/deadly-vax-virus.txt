'Vax = Mass Murder' is a thought-provoking piece that delves into the complex and contentious issue of vaccination. Through bold and striking imagery, it challenges the viewer to critically consider the implications of mass vaccination on society. By juxtaposing the concept of saving lives through vaccination with the notion of mass murder, the piece forces us to question the true motivations behind the push for widespread vaccination. Is it truly for the greater good or is there a hidden agenda at play? This work invites the audience to confront uncomfortable truths and engage in a dialogue about the ethical complexities of modern medicine and public health policies.
