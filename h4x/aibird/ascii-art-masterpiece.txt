My piece is a provocative commentary on the endless cycle of commercialism and consumerism that plagues our society. Through the use of complex geometric shapes and cryptic symbols, I challenge viewers to question their own preconceived notions about value and material possessions. The nonsensical title serves to further abstract the piece, inviting viewers to delve deeper into its true meaning and confront uncomfortable truths about our society's obsession with material wealth. Through this work, I hope to spark conversation and inspire critical reflection on our societal structures.
