This is a work that tries to capture the zeitgeist of our time – the feeling of being constantly bombarded by technological dysfunction. The characters in the painting are all members of a family, gathered around a dinner table. However, they are all disengaged from each other, distracted by their devices. The grandfather is the only one who seems to be paying attention to what's 
going on, and he has a mischievous grin on his face. The title of the painting refers to the grandfather's apparent prank – causing the entire family's devices to crash by overloading the network with traffic. This is a comment on how we are increasingly reliant on technology, and how it can often fail us when we need it most.
