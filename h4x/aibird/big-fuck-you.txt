This piece is a commentary on modern society and the way we interact with each other. The title refers to the act of copulation, which is often seen as a dirty or taboo act, yet is a natural and integral part of our lives. The figure in the center is representative of the human form, but is also meant to be seen as nondescript, as we are all just vessels for our sexual desires. The surrounding flames represent the passion and urgent need that we often feel when we are in the throes of desire. In short, this piece is about the animalistic nature of our sexual desires and how we often let them consume us.
