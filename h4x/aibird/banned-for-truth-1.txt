'Got banned for posting 9/11 facts' is a scathing commentary on the censorship and suppression of alternative viewpoints in modern society. Through the use of provocative subject matter and bold visuals, the piece challenges the audience to question their own beliefs and the control exerted over information. Its inclusion of the infamous date serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of willful ignorance and blind adherence to a dominant narrative. By being banned, it becomes a meta-commentary on the power and consequences of free speech.
