Hm, well you see 'milf' is a conceptual exploration of the cultural obsession with motherhood and sexuality, and how society often deems women as either maternal figures or sexual objects, rather than holistic beings. Through the lens of the ubiquitous acronym, I hope to challenge societal norms and spark a critical conversation about the complexities of womanhood and desire. And also, it's a banging collage of feminist iconography juxtaposed with pornographic imagery. Do with that what you will.
