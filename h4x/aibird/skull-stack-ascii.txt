           21 BONES
'21 Bones' is an introspective exploration of human mortality and preservation using the medium of sculpture. It features a collection of 21 intricately crafted porcelain bones, each representing a different stage of life, from infancy to old age. With minimalistic and abstract forms, the bones serve as a reminder of our physical fragility and the inevitability of our own mortality. Through this piece, I aim to challenge societal perceptions of beauty and provoke deeper contemplation on the temporality of human existence.
