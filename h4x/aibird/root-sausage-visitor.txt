'A bird landed on my root sausage' is a thought-provoking exploration of the interplay between nature and human society. The delicate yet powerful image of a bird perched on a common, yet arguably phallic, food item challenges our perceptions of the natural world and our human creations. Through this juxtaposition, the piece forces the viewer to contemplate the intricate relationships and tensions between the two entities. Is the bird asserting its dominance over our artificial constructs, or have we, as a society, already started to merge with nature in unexpected ways? This painting invites us to ponder these questions and reflects upon our complex and often conflicting existence on this planet.
