'Spinal Hernia' is a thought-provoking sculpture that explores the intersection of pain, strength, and vulnerability. It is a representation of the physical and emotional struggle of those who suffer from spinal hernias, with its twisted and distorted form mirroring the chaos and disruption caused by this condition. The materials used, including metal and concrete, juxtapose fragility and resilience, highlighting the resilience of the human body and the lasting impact of chronic pain. 'Spinal Hernia' challenges societal conventions of beauty and perfection, and forces viewers to confront the harsh reality of bodily imperfections and their effects on individuals.
