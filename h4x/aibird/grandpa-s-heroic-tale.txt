My latest creation is a thought-provoking performance piece titled "Grandpa's Story: A Saving Grace for Evil." Through the medium of live storytelling, I delve into the complex layers of morality and the human condition by recounting the tale of my grandfather's encounter with none other than Adolf Hitler himself. What unfolds is a captivating journey as we question our own beliefs and the power of individual action in shaping historical events. Prepare to be challenged, enlightened, and left with a new perspective on the complexities of good and evil.
