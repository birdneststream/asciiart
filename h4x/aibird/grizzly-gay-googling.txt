'Gay grizzly google gave ganders' is a thought-provoking piece that explores the power dynamics and complexities of modern relationships. Through the use of vibrant colors and juxtaposing imagery, I challenge the viewer to think about how labels and assumptions can shape our interactions with others. The title itself is a play on words, inviting viewers to question their initial interpretations and dive deeper into the underlying themes of the artwork. It is a commentary on society's tendency to assign labels and create hierarchies, and how this can limit our understanding of genuine human connections.
