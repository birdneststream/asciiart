'Dumptruck' is a visual representation of our society's obsession with consumption and waste. Through the use of repurposed materials such as old metal scraps and discarded plastic bottles, this sculpture seeks to challenge viewers' perceptions of beauty and bring attention to the growing issue of overconsumption. The stark contrast between the industrial and natural elements in 'Dumptruck' provokes contemplation on the damaging effects of our materialistic culture. It's a powerful commentary on the consequences of our actions and a reminder to consider our role in preserving the planet for future generations.
