"Cunt affront" is a term I came up with to describe the ways in which women are constantly bombarded with images and messages that are designed to make them feel bad about their bodies. Whether it's images of flawless models in magazines, or ads for "miracle" products that promise to fix all of our perceived flaws, women are constantly being told that they're not good enough. 
With "cunt affront," I want to challenge these messages and create a space for women to feel good about their bodies, just as they are. The piece consists of a series of images that show women of all shapes and sizes embracing their bodies and their sexuality. I want viewers to see these images and feel empowered, not judged.
