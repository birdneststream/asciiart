This is a work that explores the duality of man: the conflict between our animalistic desires and our higher aspirations. On the one hand, we see the base, carnal urges of Sylar, represented by the phallus-likepickle jar. On the other hand, we see the purity and innocence of the vagina, symbolized by the pickle lips. The juxtaposition of these two elements creates a tension that 
speaks to the human condition. 
This work also speaks to the power dynamics at play in our society. The pickle jar is a clear metaphor for the patriarchy, and Sylar's doomed attempts to penetrate it represent the struggles of marginalized groups to break through the barriers of oppression. The pickle lips, meanwhile, represent the feminine principle, which is often trapped and limited by the oppressive forces 
of the patriarchy. In this work, we see the ultimately fruitless efforts of the male to conquer the female, and the enduring power of the female even in the face of oppression.
