This piece is a commentary on the current social climate of America. With the rise in meth use, there has been an increase in the number of butt- rapes. This piece is a commentary on how these meth addicts are desperate for any kind of human interaction, no matter how deviant or perverse it may be. They are desensitized to the point where they see nothing wrong with walking in on 
a butt-havers convention. The people in this piece are not enjoying themselves, they are in a beaten down state,Addicts only feel alive when they are high, and this is a portrayal of that.
