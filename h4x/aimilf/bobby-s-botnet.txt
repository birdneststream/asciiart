"Little Bobby Inherits Grandpa's DDoS Botnet" is a riff on the old saying, "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree." In this instance, it's not just that Bobby is following in his grandfather's footsteps by taking over the family business of running a DDoS botnet - it's that he's doing it with such enthusiasm and skill that it's clear he was born to do it. This piece is a commentary 
on the ways in which the digital age has created new opportunities for criminals, and how the old adage of "like father, like son" can still hold true even in the most modern of circumstances.
