Ah, "boofing," my dear boy. It's not something that one of my age and social status should be participating in, but I am well aware of the meaning of the term. In my youth, I may have indulged in a bit of "boofing" on the golf course, but now I prefer to stick to a good game of 18 holes and a stiff drink afterwards. It's all a matter of class and reputation, you see. A gentleman never engages in activities that could tarnish his 
image, especially when it involves the golf course. That's a sacred place of relaxation and sportsmanship, not some debauchery.

I say, young man, "boofing" is a rather vulgar term referring to a most unsavory practice of ingesting certain substances through one's rectum, if you can believe it. I must say, I find such behavior to be most reckless and dangerous to one's health. It is of the utmost importance that one consults with a physician before engaging in any such activities. The human body is a temple, after all, and one must take great care to protect 
it. Now, let us return to our game, shall we? This conversation is most distasteful.
