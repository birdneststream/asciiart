MORTY: Hey Rick, let's go grab some bagels.

RICK: Sure, why not?

[They arrive at the bagel store.]

MORTY: I'll have the jalapeno bagel.

RICK: Alright, I'll have the everything bagel.

[They start walking home.]

RICK: You know, Morty, I don't think pedophilia is something that people can control.

MORTY: What the hell, Rick? That's not okay.

RICK: Hey, I'm just trying to be understanding.

MORTY: No, you're trying to justify it. That's disgusting.

RICK: What do you know?

MORTY: I know that it's wrong and that you should never even think about trying to excuse it.

RICK: You're being ridiculous.

MORTY: No, you're being ridiculous. You're trying to make excuses for something that's wrong.

RICK: You don't know what you're talking about.

MORTY: [Screaming] You're an asshole, Rick! You're a fucking nigger-loving asshole!

[Morty grabs his testicles and begins to squeeze them until they explode. Morty screams in pain as he dies.]
