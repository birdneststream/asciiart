This domain shouldn't exist
Recently .zip became a publicly available top-level domain. Please consider contacting ICANN who coordinates all domains on the Internet, or Google which is the sponsor and registry for .zip and voice your opinion on the gTLD. Hopefully with enough pushback they will prioritize our collective good above other factors and shut down the gTLD
