Do you look at other people’s ASCIIs and compare them to your own? Does this make you question whether you are smart, fit or happy enough with your chats?
If so, then you may be a chatfectionist. Writing for #h4x earlier this year, clinical psychologist Ms Chatswood described a chatfectionist as a person: “who strives for flawlessness, for a perfect creation of ascii, outcome or chat performance ... They find it difficult to log off irc, even if that means neglecting their health, relationships and wellbeing in pursuit of a ‘perfect’ ascii.”
According to some studies, this is something that largely affects incels. A US survey in 2009 found that incels are also more likely than sex havers to experience feelings of inadequacy in chats, and a larger proportion felt they failed to meet their own high standards when it came to ASCII creation.
