Absolutely appalled by the way I was treated at #jrh. The bird man I was serviced by (seemed like the owner) had horrid phone service and was even worse in person. Never in my life have I been treated so poorly by any chat room ever. I came in to have a ASCII redone because it wasn't done properly the first time by this ASCII editor and I was treated like a burden to them. There was no hello, no smile. He just sighed when I 
came in and shoved his hand at me and said "patreon please". I then had to wait for nearly 40 minutes with no where to sit. There was no air conditioning inside and it was a hot, humid day! They were in the middle of unpacking a variety of IRC servers which was left half opened and strewn all about the nest floor, so I couldn't even walk around to look at anything while I waited. He got one of their younger coders, perhaps the 
apprentice, perhaps the same person who didn't do the job properly the first time to 'fix it'. When it was over, he just shoved the ASCII editor back in my hand and said "all done". He barely looked me in the eye, his entire tone, body language and attitude was just repulsive. He couldn't make me feel more uncomfortable if he tried! I will never come here again and never recommend this channel to anyone! I bet if I were a 
shemale I would have been treated differently. Terrible customer service, terrible chat service! Avoid!
