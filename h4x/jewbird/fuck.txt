Walking home today, some fucker bumped into me and instantly started talking shit about how lrh being the best radio hour. I tried to remain calm and explain to him that jrh was actually the best radio hour, but he wouldn't take a hint. He started throwing around words like "ddos king" and I lost it. Punched him right in his lrh loving fuck face. I hate l0de so goddamn much
