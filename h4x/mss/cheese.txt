Feet have the same bacteria on its surface than cheese has. There is a theory that a foot fetish and the desire to suck and lick feet comes from an Vitamin K2 deficiency. It makes sense, as most guys with a foot fetish exhibit signs of K2 deficiency. What do you think of this? I first read about this on this forum. A user in a thread regarding foot fetish talked about this.
