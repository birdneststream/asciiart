how do i link my bank account?
if i ever get married again i'll buy my wife flowers every week
my son makes me so mad sometimes but i love him more than anything
this would be so much more meaningful if we could read about the soldiers' backstories
how did they end up here?
hard to know when a phonecall from my bank is real. even the real call centres have indians now. a lot has changed
my boss at the store is a good man but it's hard to take orders from someone 10 years younger than me. when did young men start wearing makeup?
truly crestfallen to hear the terrorists have one but it was inevitable with starmer's migration policies. stop the boats!
where can i read up on the terrorists' ideology?
i have $400 in my account but i did not deposit it. there's been a terrible mistake. i did not intend to commit fraud

there ought to be a geneva convention on losing all your money. is this not inhumane treatment? am i not tortured?

i remember when this game first came out. begged my mum to get us a PC that could run it properly but she was always like "i had two jobs at your age" like sorry you were in the factory at 16yo mum but its normal for a 33yo to be unemployed now
was glad when she got dementia tbh felt like payback
