What will happen when you block the orangeclub members?
( == When you block the entire CloudFlare IPs on your router)
Before blocking:
1. Silently MITM attempt everywhere.
2. Everything I input is routed to the USA.
After blocking:
1. My browser complain & Save time by not opening timewasting site; We can't connect to the server
2. I can annoy website owner; 'I cannot open your site'
3. More Going offline time, more physical interaction irl.
4. More walking.
5. I lost online 'friends' yet I made some real friends offline.
6. The much less chance to get CF know about me.
Blocking CloudFlare keeping me healthy.
10/10 definitely recommend it.
