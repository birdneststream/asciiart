'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the casa,
Not a creature was stirring; Caramba! Que pasa!
The ni√±os were all tucked firmly into their camas,
Some in vestidos and some in pijamas,
While mama worked late in her little cocina, and
El Viejo was down at the corner cantina.
The stockings were hanging con mucho cuidado
In hopes that St. Nicolas would feel oligado,
To bring all of the children, both buenos and malos,
A nice bunch of dulces and other regalos. Then
Outside in the yard there occured such a grito
That I jumped to my feet like a frightened cabrito.
I ran to my window and looked out afuera,
And who in the world do you think it era?
St. Nick in a sleigh wearing a big red sombrero
Came dashing along like a crazy bonbero!
And pulling his sleigh instead of venados,
Were eight little burros, approaching volados.
I watched as they came, and this quaint little hombre
Was shouting and whistling and calling by nombre:
"Ay, Pancho! Ay, Pepe! Ay, Cuca! Ay, Beto!
Ay, Chato! Ay, Chopo! Ay, Maruco y Nieto!"
Then standing up tall with his hand on his pecho,
He flew to the top of our very own techo.
With his round little belly shaking like a bowl of jalea,
He struggled to squeeze down our old chimenea.
Then, huffing and puffing, at last in our sala,
He stood with soot smeared all over his red suit de gala.
Hi filled all the stocking, each with a lovely regalo,
Then he turned and, in a flash, was gone like the viento
And I heard him exclaim as he flew out of sight (and this is verdad)
Merry Christmas to all! Feliz Navidad!
